0,Bouddhanath,Religious Sites,4.5,Largest Stup,"Try to stay a little bit longer in outside after visiting the inner parts, while sipping a coffee from a small cafe. Morning time is the best time for photo or slow motion video when the birds suddenly swing."

2,Bouddhanath,Religious Sites,4.5,The largest stupa in the world,It is an ethereal sight the Boudhnath Stupa. Its imposing structure could be seen from our hotel and we visited in the afternoon.

12,Swayambhunath Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Simply awesome!,"I arrived here early in the morning, so there were less people. It is a historical place, and a UNESCO site. So much to see. Lots of stray dogs, vendors and trash. Although, the little annoyance are in the way, I think its a beautiful place to view one of the stupas. I think people should be mindful of the plenty of monkeys around. The view of the valley from this place is absolutely stunning. There are shops inside and stores with paintings. I bought a painting made by one of the grand master. The prayer flags and prayer wheels added beauty to this place. When in Nepal, make time to visit."

15,Swayambhunath Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,A must while in Kathmandu - but beware of the stairs!,Climbing up past monkeys to reach the top and be greeted by an epic stupa is something Id recommend to anyone visiting Kathmandu. Fun to see monkeys anyway and the panoramic views from the top are amazing. Make sure to go past the stupa to the other side of the hill to see even more views and more interesting Nepalese architecture
16,Swayambhunath Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,best place,"We had been there during our Kathmandu stay, this is one of the best places if you are not scared of amounts of money."
17,Swayambhunath Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,More fun than Everest!,"Seriously, if you love monkeys you will love your visit. We had an amazing time. In fact, I put this right up there with my 2 days spent at the Everest View Hotel.  I mean, whats better than hanging out with more than 100 monkeys?"

21,Pashupatinath Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Peaceful place,"This is an interesting place to visit while in Nepal. I learned a lot about Hindu culture and especially how they honor the last day of their beloved who passed away. They have to perform certain rituals before theyre cremated. Loved ones are there and assisting to finalize the cremation. People can watch from the other side of the river. The temple is a beautiful site, I think its perfect for the ones who are gone.  I say bring a mask if you cant stand the scent of the smoke. Prayers to all who passed."
22,Pashupatinath Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Old Best Hindu temple,Best place nearby international airport Hindu temple old temple and you can see cremation of Hindu culture Best for history culture and religion.
23,Pashupatinath Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Pashupatinath visit in October 2022,Pashupatinath temple is among the 12 jyotirlinga.  Beautiful temple and must visit if you are in Kathmandu.  As the temple opens at around 4am best time is to visit at that time as it is completely empty. It closes at 7pm that is after the aarti. After 6am it starts getting crowded.
24,Pashupatinath Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,One of the finest temples of Lord Shiva,We went there twice on our trip. The first time due to a heavy rush on Monday we could not have proper darshan of Mahadev but compensated that with a beautiful darshan on Friday morning. Please be aware that there are huge crowds on Monday and Saturday so prepare accordingly. Also the temple remains closed in the afternoon from 12-5 and is open in the evening only from 5-6.30. Also  be careful of the monkeys. But do visit the other small temples near the main shrine.
25,Pashupatinath Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,The Great HINDU Temple,Wonderful holy temple in Kathmandu - just a mile away from the Airport and gets crowded many times during peak morning and evening hours.Have been visiting the temple year after year and the glory of the deity and the premises is intact.Cleanliness needs some improvement.
26,Pashupatinath Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Extremely interesting,A truly interesting experience. Live cremations happening right on the river and a huge complex of temples to see. We picked up a tour guide (somewhat unexpectedly - he just started talking to us!) but he was actually super informative and very interesting (ended up costing ~$30 which felt a bit steep though). Definitely worth a visit!
27,Pashupatinath Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Solo female foreign travellers be aware,"Sadly did not get to have a look.Was dropped off by a lovely taxi, then proceeded to be followed by 4 men. As a foreign, solo 50yo female tourist I had to take evasive action to keep myself and my belongings safe. It is locally known of bag theft, pick pocketing (found out afterwards). Lucky some Hindu ladies seen how distressed I was and stayed with me until a taxi came. From discussions with locals it is common but goes unreported.In my experience I would NOT recommend females to visit here alone."
28,Pashupatinath Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,kailash journeys,Must visit temple for Hindus. Lord Siva with five mukhas. Amazing temple which transcends time. Felt lucky to be visiting.
29,Pashupatinath Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,nice place in kathmandu,it is one of the best spiritual place to visit in Kathmandu. it is really different experience to be there and see all death ceremony of Hindu people.
30,Chandragiri Hills,Mountains,4.5,great Gondola ride for views near Kathmandu,Beautiful new gondola to hilltop and very nice Himalayan range views including top of Mt Everest.  Adequate nice restaurant at top.
31,Chandragiri Hills,Mountains,4.5,One of the best tourist places in Kathmandu,"Chandragiri Hills is a very well maintained property slightly away from the city but worth a visit. The ropeway offers breathtaking views and the temple of Mahadev above is beautiful. You can do zip lining, view the Everest through telescope and your child can play in the playzone. There are numerous food options. Pls remember that the ropeway is non operational between 12-1 pm and 4-5 pm."
32,Chandragiri Hills,Mountains,4.5,great energy,"taking trips with alphine club of himalaya  who arrange the trip to chandragiri hills , taking cable car vv seeing the beautiful temple up there and tried the local food momo"

39,Chandragiri Hills,Mountains,4.5,Best trip organized by trekkers home in thamel,We are 6 altogether and stayed at hotel trekkers home in thamel. Trekkers home team organized the day tour for us only at 2000 per person. Good team organized the trip very efficiently. Will definitely choose trekkers home team for our next trekking in coming days.
40,Kopan Monastery,Religious Sites,4.5,monastery out of bounds,"the monastery is beautiful, however, it can only be viewed from outside. Only monks and pupils are allowed to go in. Though it is a shame about the monastery, you can go for a hike to nearby Gokarneshwar and other areas which are nearby."
41,Kopan Monastery,Religious Sites,4.5,Beautiful inside but not allowed to enter,"Don't waste your time it's closed for visitors, only monks and pupils studying at school. Construction works going on along side"
42,Kopan Monastery,Religious Sites,4.5,Good place to Hike,stunning place to explore around if you are in Kathmandu. If you are looking for small hike around the Kathmandu then this could be the best for you to explore around
43,Kopan Monastery,Religious Sites,4.5,visit to Kopan,"amazing monastery. brings glimpses of old time. great art and architecture. blissful and serene place for blessings of the lord. monks are very courteous and kind. even in the times of covid, it is open for blessing seekers."
44,Kopan Monastery,Religious Sites,4.5,Love this spot.,"Lovely and peaceful place, you can do mediation out there, at least to spend 2 to 3 hours at this attraction. it is one of the major attractions in Kathmandu."

46,Kopan Monastery,Religious Sites,4.5,"place for peace, chanting heaven","excellent place, excellent peace of mind.... When we feel some disturb  from the hectic schedule, highly recommended to this place."
47,Kopan Monastery,Religious Sites,4.5,Remarkable Cultural Experience,This monastery is very peaceful and the great prayer hall is a sight to behold especially during the religious devotionals. A great monument to Tibetan Buddhism.
48,Kopan Monastery,Religious Sites,4.5,A peaceful and restful place,"As soon as one enters the monastery, one can easily feel the positive vibration emanated there.My guide show me the way to salute and the significance of the statues."
49,Kopan Monastery,Religious Sites,4.5,Calm and quite place...,We visited the kopan monastery on our way back from the sleeping Vishnu temple ( Buddha nilkantha ) . It's a very quite place and that's how it should be. Serene beauty with a lot of things to learn about Buddhism here. If u are an adventure freak then this is not a place for you. This place is for those who want to take a step towards meditation and peace .
50,Thamel,Neighborhoods,4,City Center,For one or two night is fine. Not Much. It is city center Area for buying trekking gears with many hotels and restaurants
51,Thamel,Neighborhoods,4,most busy mountain tourist area,"from the mountaineering gear until clubs are here, lots of restaurant & coffee shops, also souvenirs shops. just prepare your money and be ready to buy a new bag/luggage."
52,Thamel,Neighborhoods,4,Walking Streets gone from Thamel! Vehicles and hoards of speeding motorcycles are back!,"Currently, Sep-Oct2022, vehicle traffic in Thamel is once again loud, crowded, fast and dangerous, particularly the motorcycles.In 2017, Walking Streets were established in several parts of Thamel. That was a long time coming and long overdue. It greatly added to the attractiveness and pleasantness for tourists and businesses alike. (see my review, April 2018).Now, post - Covid, the walking streets have disappeared and the traffic is a horrible insane mess. Other tourists are similarly disappointed. Please! Restore the sanity!I have been coming to Nepal for over 30 years. I now normally come here twice a year as a tourist, usually for a month or more each time. But this trip was an unenjoyable and intolerable experience because of the traffic volume and noise! I could hardly wait to take my flight out of the craziness. I wonder if I will return, unless the situation improves."
53,Thamel,Neighborhoods,4,A disappointing visit,We had heard glowing revies of this place as the party capital of Kathmandu but were disappointed. The market was also catering mainly to trekkers. There were many ppl there who looked shady and certainly did not feel safe.
54,Thamel,Neighborhoods,4,Another interesting place to visit in Nepal,"Thamel is the place to go if you want to see lots of interesting shops and restaurants. A hub of where travelers go to buy outfits to wear mountain trekking. I went here to check out Pilgrims Bookstore and to purchase cashmere scarves. The streets are narrow, so be careful when walking and enjoying this place, as there are motorists. The shop owners are friendly and truly enjoy your business.If you like handicrafts, beads and singing bowls, this is the place to go"
55,Thamel,Neighborhoods,4,"Frys the nerves, but has amenities","30 years ago this place and Freak Street must have been great with only bicycles.  Now it just frys the nerves.  Walking around Thamel I feel like I'm a pin at a bowling alley.  The narrow roads put you inches from motos zipping by, and horrible exhaust makes you want to wear a gas mask.  Honking horns and hawkers in your face (my friend, my friend, where are you from) add to the ""get me out of here"" ambience. There is a street that is pedestrian only, but that just makes the fewer motos that go down the street that much crazier/faster.  They need to make the whole area truly pedestrian.  Still, Thamel has the best food in Kathmandu."
56,Thamel,Neighborhoods,4,Center of the city,"Nice and interesting, but busy, crowded and animated, for some night life, that sector is recommanded, otherwise many restaurants in the areas, lots of stores for trekking material, or buddhist artefacts"
57,Thamel,Neighborhoods,4,Crowded but pitoresque,"We did not stay in Thamel, but stopped by for an afternoon. Interestingly, similar merchandise was carried by stores clustered next to each other making shopping for specific items very convenient (we were looking for scarves). Apart from that, as pedestrians we had to keep being on the lookout for cars that were rushing through the narrow streets. It was noisy, and dynamic, and found it good for a day adventure but not to our preference for an overnight stay."
58,Thamel,Neighborhoods,4,Hangout Zone of Kathmandu,best place for chill hangout and stay in Kathmandu Nepal. You can find good food and drinks in Thamel. Heart of the Kathmandu City
59,Thamel,Neighborhoods,4,Too many shops,There are so many shops here and they all want your business but it is a must visit place.  Remember to barter
60,Garden of Dreams,Gardens,4.5,a popular oasis near Thamel,"Sadly, the teahouse/restaurant inside has closed, but the garden is still a restful little park, with some nice architectural features, and a good place to retreat from the hubbub of the surrounding streets.  There are cute little striped squirrels scurrying around the flower beds, which will give some entertainment."
61,Garden of Dreams,Gardens,4.5,Oasis in the City,The Garden of Dreams is a lovely peaceful garden in the middle of bustling Kathmandu. Entry Nrs 200 pp. Well worth visiting on the way to Thamel.
62,Garden of Dreams,Gardens,4.5,Nice Gardens,The gardens were very pretty and we enjoyed this little oasis in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Kathmandu.
63,Garden of Dreams,Gardens,4.5,Fine place but not soecial,"It was nice, but a bit of a disappointment.  Noisier than expected. A small garden, filthy bathrooms in spite of a high (for here) entrance fee. Some pretty flowers and a nice display left over from Dewali"
64,Garden of Dreams,Gardens,4.5,nice garden,"very nice garden even now the cafe is not exist anymore since pandemic time they said, i hope the cafe is open when we are back next year"
65,Garden of Dreams,Gardens,4.5,"Overpriced, dirty toilets, very rude manager, super disrespectful towards the visitors.","Overpriced, dirty toilets, very rude manager, super disrespectful towards the visitors.*This was the worst experience in Nepal. Of course, the price for a little garden, as a lot of people have already mentioned, is way too high. But I was willing to pay it, because I needed some quite place in busy Kathmandu (to film myself, a video for my work). I was very quiet, sitting on a bench in the corner. But the stuff came and asked me to stop. They took me to the manager and he was extremely rude. They made a problem out of nothing (because everyone is filming there and taking selfies non-stop). But I was talking on camera, so this is, apparently, not allowed. Anyways, the rules are the rules (even if completely strange and stupid), but they were rude to me, spoiled my day and refused to return me my money for the visit. I felt that they don't care much about the customers and that they were disrespectful and the whole visit left me in a worst mood for the rest of the day. This is not a good service and this is definitely has nothing to do with hospitality, which should be present in a touristic places like this."
66,Garden of Dreams,Gardens,4.5,Heavenly oasis in the madness of Kathmandu,An excellent spot to sit and relax in an otherwise hectic Kathmandu. Very quiet and peaceful and worth the small entry fee for sure. Bring a book and enjoy the calm!
67,Garden of Dreams,Gardens,4.5,Still as peaceful as before,"Silent, serene and peaceful; there are the words that would be best to describe this place. IN my previous trips to Nepal, Garden of Dreams was my my go to place to just refresh myself from the hustle and bustle of the city, all the activities and just find a quiet time for myself. Returning here after Covid, I am glad to say that not much has changed and it still offers a peaceful place  like it used to before."
68,Garden of Dreams,Gardens,4.5,Not interesting - quite small for its price,"This is one of those places that may be interesting if it's in your hometown, but traveling so far (many of us make +7000 km) and spending time seeing this... I don't think it's a good use of the time. I found it generic and not interesting. Also the price was way too high considering its size and the price of other tourist attractions."
69,Garden of Dreams,Gardens,4.5,a place where you can chill,"apart from busy traffic outside, just being here is a different atmosphere.surrounded with big trees , different design of the buildings make us feel so comfortable, just sit and reading book or doing meditation"
70,Namo Buddha (Stupa),Religious Sites,4.5,Namo Buddha,This holy pilgrimage place is like spending a day in the heavens. The history and holiness permeates the air.
71,Namo Buddha (Stupa),Religious Sites,4.5,STUPA VISIT - and SURROUNDING AREA INTERESTING,The Stupa was beautiful set in a very nice area for local shops and also a monastery.  The visit to the monastery was a real treat with the young children in school.  We witnessed the Monks doing their prayers.  The area was clean and we felt safe.  Bought items from several stores.
72,Namo Buddha (Stupa),Religious Sites,4.5,Peaceful Walk,"We walked from the main road up through the hills and fields, lovely escape from Kathmandu, so peaceful with fresh air and an interesting take on a historical stupa."
73,Namo Buddha (Stupa),Religious Sites,4.5,most place to visit,been here recent visit and this place is quiet nice for the natural and love to see the stupa. one of the best place to visit again.

77,Namo Buddha (Stupa),Religious Sites,4.5,The eastern Jewels of Nepal,"Its location is comparatively far from the Kathmandu city, but after reaching over there, its just marvelous. Spectacular  views and the real jewels of Buddhism."
78,Namo Buddha (Stupa),Religious Sites,4.5,Excellent Day Trip,"The location was quite far from Kathmandu's main city. We had been here for a family dry picnic. This place is an important Buddhist pilgrimage site in Nepal. Namo Buddha is the best place for refreshment, a magnificent view of nature and many other natural things."
79,Namo Buddha (Stupa),Religious Sites,4.5,Om Maane PAdme hummm,Excellent place for the peace lovers... Enchanting mantras and Monks behavior was just incredible. We felt so calm at this place
80,Kathmandu Durbar Square,Historic Sites,4,Durbar Square,"Durbar Square is a very interesting site in Kathmandu.  Entry NRs 1000 pp. Many old buildings and religious sites, some damaged by earthquakes. Interesting museum. Well worth visiting."
81,Kathmandu Durbar Square,Historic Sites,4,Historical palace and temples to visit,"It was a little crowded when I arrived here, nevertheless, I thought the place is unique and interesting. Temples being rebuilt and others were restored. Although it was overwhelming for me (pigeons everywhere), I was able to see the beauty of this place. Its best to have a tour guide who will explain to you the history of this place. Lots of nice architecture"
82,Kathmandu Durbar Square,Historic Sites,4,A World Heritage site worth visiting,The Durbar square of Kathmandu contains 48 temples the most famous of which houses the Kumari or the Living Goddess. Kindly take a guide to know the historical significance of the various temples. There is an entry fee to this place and should take about one hour.
83,Kathmandu Durbar Square,Historic Sites,4,An interesting spot to spend a few hours,A very interesting and historic spot in Kathmandu. Yes you pay 1000 to enter but that goes towards supporting its restoration and there is a lot to see while youre in there. Id recommend going for lunch / a coffee at one of the restaurants in the square while youre there and watching the world go by in this historic setting
84,Kathmandu Durbar Square,Historic Sites,4,first impression - awesome,admired with all the wood craft and detail in it.each temples belongs to goddes and the stories behind it.
85,Kathmandu Durbar Square,Historic Sites,4,PLEASE AVOID! Harassed non stop!,"Sorry to say but PLEASE AVOID! Harassed non stop by official guides, really really unpleasently. Lots of children also sent out to beg from tourists. Worst expirience within Nepal. High upfront cost of 1000 NRP per person, we had to evacuate withing 10min because of the nonstop harrasement."
86,Kathmandu Durbar Square,Historic Sites,4,Don't waste your money going there,It is a horrible mess as a result of the earthquake and you have to pay a lot of money to walk around what is a construction site. Patan's Durbar square is much better
87,Kathmandu Durbar Square,Historic Sites,4,Basantapur Durbar Square,"Historical place to visit , antique place such a maze visit once when you will be in ktm , basantapur Durbar Square "
88,Kathmandu Durbar Square,Historic Sites,4,lots of temple and really beautiful,Kathmandu Durbar Square is located in front of the old royal palace of the former Kathmandu Kingdom. This place is really beautiful.
89,Kathmandu Durbar Square,Historic Sites,4,"Durbar square, lots of temple","I read the name of 19 temples on description of this very famous sqare, next to Freak street, very popular during the 1960, 70's, 80's, then the tourists started moving towards Thamel, but this place is one of the emblematic sqare in the city, World Heritage site, some temples were destroyed during the 2015 earthquake, still not entirely rebuild today, but the visit is surely worth it, a must in fact"
90,Asan,Flea & Street Markets,4.5,Not for the faint of heart!,"If you are new to large Asian and middle eastern markets, hang onto your hat (and your belongings)!  This bazaar is a wild experience, even for the well-heeled global traveler.  You will be packed shoulder to shoulder with bikes, cars, fruit carts, and other people--to name a few things!  But the noise, sights, and stalls will be something to remember.  Sensory overload for sure!  What can't you find at this bazaar?Recommend keeping your money close and do not bother with a large camera/any camera.Be brave and give it a try!  It is sure to result in a story."
91,Asan,Flea & Street Markets,4.5,Large local bazaar near Thamel,"Quite the place. Really crowded but people are nice and keeping some distance while walking. Got to experience the evening bazaar too. Went there again today and the place has all kinds of shops. Starting from clothing, shoes to food, masala etc."
92,Asan,Flea & Street Markets,4.5,Typical Market - one must visit.,Ancient traditional market within residential square located central of Kathmandu and easily accessible from the Touristic Hub Thamel and Kathmandu Durbar square. This is one of the recommeded local spice market for spice lovers.
93,Asan,Flea & Street Markets,4.5,Energetic,Visited twice. Very clean. Best to wander lanes & get lost amongst people & stalls. Amazing bargains on numerous items.
94,Asan,Flea & Street Markets,4.5,Like nowhere else!,"In terms of sheer throng and urban craziness, this area of Kathmandu outdoes Accra, Bangkok, Colombo, Delhi, and everywhere else through the whole alphabet! The rules and distinctions of traffic, trade and pedestrians are utterly blurred and though its thoroughly exhausting, its also pretty thrilling to be caught up in! Some great shopping to be found too, away from the higher prices of Thamel."
95,Asan,Flea & Street Markets,4.5,So colorful !!,"I was there on the eve of Diwali festival, that area was full of stalls and people, I was stuck there for a while because it was too many motorbikes and people crossing from all corners, I found it difficult to move."
96,Asan,Flea & Street Markets,4.5,Very busy area,The Annapurna temple is beautiful and all around it are some very busy streets. I walked from Naya Bazaar to Asan to Durban Square to the Monkey temple and back and didnt get lost at all. Prices are keen but as a dentist area I may wait until I get home
97,Asan,Flea & Street Markets,4.5,Welcome to the market and the caos,"Really good place to feel the real nepali life with all the motorbikes, cars and people selling all kind of things in a narrow streets where you can get lose.If you look around you can even find streets where the motorbikes can not go inside, because is to narrow, and that give you a breathe from all the noise.However you can find all kind of staff, food, clothes, jewerely,... I truly recommend this place you will enjoy it a lot"
98,Asan,Flea & Street Markets,4.5,The Durbar Square,The market is over populated and busiest point in Kathmandu. The place contains relics of temples which are being restored on a daily basis.
99,Asan,Flea & Street Markets,4.5,a real local shopping experience,"it is the perfect place if you want to have a local shopping experience. it is very busy and crowded but it is a very interesting place and the prices there cheaper than elsewhere.i loved it because i could find what i wanted: Sari. it is an immense and a wild variety of sari and all fabrics, i bought sari in India and in Sri Lanka but here is cheaper and nicer.while walking through, you'll smell strange smells but i really did not pay attention to these details because i was focusing on the variety of products and the artisanal stuff.the price you are told, pay only 60% of it, you have to bargainaround, there are lot of coffee shops and restaurants"
100,Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park,National Parks,4.5,100% disappointing.,"4000 rupees with a guide, 2000 rupees without a guide just to see a pollute valley below.  100% not worth it.  There must be a better way to spend the day."
101,Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park,National Parks,4.5,Jungle Experience,"We went on hike around the National Park in the winter season.We saw Hog Plum plants everywhere which can only be found in Nepal.Best for a jungle experience and nature getaways. Rock climbing is one of the activities, that park offers.I would suggest to walk with a guide as the hiking trails go deep into the forest.Waterfalls and small river streams can be seen on the way."
102,Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park,National Parks,4.5,Scam for tourists/foreigners!,"They are absolutely shameless! I get it that tourist should pay more, and a price of 1000 npr  (per day) for foreigners is okay for the entrance. But they won't let you in the park without a guide for a hiking trip of 6 hours. So they said we have to pay 5500 npr (2 persons, 21000 npr entry and 3500 npr for a guide; last offer was 3750 npr) for a little hike of only 6 hours. By the way: Nepalis are paying only for the entrance and they don't even need a guide. For Langtang you only pay 3000 npr for 15 days and you don't need a guide. I'm really sure that they are trying to scam tourist. Sad to watch and impressive how confident they are while talking such a bullsh/t."
103,Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park,National Parks,4.5,my home for a year,lived in there for a year. loved the serenity and the view. from the top of the Shivpuri pick u can see a great view. loved the place always.
104,Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park,National Parks,4.5,'Paradise Within Reach',"The only remaining serene, natural and beautiful park within 15 kilometers from kathmandu centre. never miss."
105,Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park,National Parks,4.5,Nature and Beauty,"I visited this park with a group of friend for picnic (just before getting inside the park) followed by short hiking. It is a dense, lush green and well preserved national park which is protected for watershed and wildlife reserve. Well secured by the Nepal Army and people have to pay an entrance fees to get inside. There are some resorts, restaurants etc. closed to park area that provides a great opportunity to visitors to enjoy fully. A must to visit place and enjoy hiking, forest fun, great flora and fauna and if lucky enough chances to some animals as well."
106,Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park,National Parks,4.5,An awesome place for a short trip away from madness of KTM and a day hike,"I arranged to go there with a company I used two years ago so I had my guide. It was only to make my life easier having one day. You can do it on your own - bus trips take longer. It costs 1050 for a foreigner to enter the park as you need a local guide. The guide I spoke with was smart - he happily took the 1000 rupee fee but said that as I have my guide he does not have to go. Fair enough - less noise on the way up. They say that the hike to Nagi Gompa - Buddhist nunnery takes 2.5h - maybe if you are bird watching as it took us 45 mins - it's only 4km and it's moderately up. As the local guide wanted probably to make more money that day, we were free to hike to the peak, which apparently costs 3000 and not 1000 rupees with a local guide. Just be aware. The entire hike took good 5h - going up from the nunnery side its beautiful, we decided to go down the other side and it was a hit and miss - views were not that good and it's basically hundreds and hundreds of steps - I hate hiking on stairs and my knees paid for this. Just know that there are two ways up to the peak if you want to start and finish in the same place - the one via Nagi Gompa offers beautiful views, the other one (taking left after the entrance to the park) is steeper with unnecessary steps. Have fun - we saw the Langtang Mountain Range and it made my day."
107,Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park,National Parks,4.5,Abundant Wildlife,"The setting of the lodge is the National Park.We went on several treks to see wildlife.There are rhinos,elephants and tons of birds set in their natural habitat.It was amazing to see them in the wild.We had a naturalist on our treks to give us information.It is well worth seeing."
108,Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park,National Parks,4.5,Hike off your jet-lag,Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park offers great day hike and a nice way to shake off the jet lag before heading to base camp or the higher mountains. The forests is beautiful and we saw lots of birds including the Kalij Pheasant. We also saw and heard a bird the locals refer to as the laughing bird but were unable to identify. The stupa at the top was charming. A peaceful place for a lunch.
109,Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park,National Parks,4.5,Hike,Great with guides..  please visit once and make #visitNepal2020 successful. Lots of places still to explore
110,Kailashnath Mahadev,Monuments & Statues,4.5,The Tallest Shiva in the world,"This 144 feet tall statue is the tallest Shiva in the world. Built of cement, copper and zinc, this statue has a very beautiful smiling face of Lord Shiva. It is in Bharkatpur in Nepal. About 2 hr drive from Kathmandu. A nominal entrance fee is levied. The entire location is calm , beautiful and well maintained. A shop selling snacks and artifacts is in place near the statue. A must - see in Nepal."
111,Kailashnath Mahadev,Monuments & Statues,4.5,just a statue,located bit far from ktm and near to bhaktapur. just a statue with nothing nearby. can be a stopover place while going anywhere. not suggested to visit only for it.
112,Kailashnath Mahadev,Monuments & Statues,4.5,Just average,"Dropped by this site on my way to Dhulikel. Just a tall statue overlooking Bhaktapur city, really not very much to see."

117,Kailashnath Mahadev,Monuments & Statues,4.5,Lord Shiva,Nearly about 140 ft long statue of Lord shiva situated nealy 20 kms away from the Kathmandu City. The place is very religious and so many tourists come here from all walks of life to enjoy the sceneric beauty of this site
118,Kailashnath Mahadev,Monuments & Statues,4.5,Visit to Kailadhnath Mahadev,Nice place to visit near Kathmandu. It is about 20 km from city centre Kathmandu. You have to entry fee of INR 60 per person if wants to access easy way otherwise very diffucult to reach Kailashnath  Mahadev through outer way. Which is hillside.
119,Kailashnath Mahadev,Monuments & Statues,4.5,Interesting sight on the way to Dhulikhel and beyond,"If you want experience Nepalese devotion and happy time sharing, this place is wonderful ! There is no tourist scam, there are lots of pilgrims from all parts of Nepal (alone this makes it nice), very few tourist and lot of people from the Kathmandu valley on the weekends (maybe avoid Saturday, it's really crowded)"
120,Dakshinkali Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Amazing place,"Religious place, I suggest to travel early in the morning so that you can see beautiful hills on the way. Dakshinkali Temple is a beautiful place to visit."
121,Dakshinkali Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,jai ma kali,"amazing temple. brings peace and a kind of vibration once you enter the premises. great art and architecture. blissful and serene place for blessings of the ma kali. . even in the times of covid, it is open for blessing seekers."
122,Dakshinkali Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Kali temple,a typical temple for Hindus. not clean or nice.  animals are sacrificed here.  can be crowded on special days.
123,Dakshinkali Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Live Animal Sacrifices...Not for the Sensitive of Quesy!,"Apparently Tuesday and Saturday are the two days when there are a lot of animal sacrifices.  However, when I went, my guide told me that sacrifices happen daily, and that many tourists do not come here because of the live sacrifices.  I have a strong stomach, so I was eager to witness this.  For me, the most memorable part of the trip was seeing a chicken and 2 goats get sacrificed while alive.  It is not possible to take pictures, but it it possible to witness the beheading of the animals.  This is not for people who have weak stomachs.  There is a lot of blood, and if you are animal lover, you will not want to see this, but I thought it was fascinating to see the cultural practices of different religions."
124,Dakshinkali Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Very interesting. Bit confusing.,"To an outsider, this temple is a bit confusing.It was great to see the locals going about their daily life.Well worth a visit."
125,Dakshinkali Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Temple Visit - Not for Feint Hearted,"I left Shambling Boutique Hotel at 1500 and reached Pharping village , 22 km away from Kathmandu at 1600 on 3rd November , 2018 . The village was an one street one . I followed the street boasting stalls selling Pooja materials, trinkets and cocks, pigeons & uncastrated male goats for sacrifice . At the end of the street , on the left side there were long stairs leading to the revered Dakshinkali Temple . As I didnt want to offer any sacrifice and just wanted to take photographs , there was no need for me to stand in the queue . Near the temple , there was a raised view point to witness the proceedings . Main entrance was protected by beautiful brass fencing . There were many little ,beautiful brass lamps fixed on the fencing . Two intricately carved brass lions were guarding the entrance of this fencing .People carrying  the animals directly went to  the place where they were sacrificed to the goddess Kali . It seemed goats knew their imminent death as it was reflected in their eyes . They were very reluctant to move forward . I  documented sacrifices of few cocks , goats and a buffalo . It was a gory job to do . Two young men ln hoodies , were so expert in slicing the neck of cocks , in front of a 60 cm high Kali statue , that in a single sweep of knife they used to behead the cock and threw the head over an adjoining  roof . Crows were partying on such heads .After the sacrifice , the devotees sprinkle the cock / goat blood on both themselves and the Kali idol . Then they used to drag their offerings to the nearby bloody stream to , wash , butcher and prepare the feast . Tips :Timings : 0600 to 2100Sacrifices are offered only on Tuesday and Saturday If one wants to sacrifice the animal / bird , she should be mentally prepared to stand in a queue for at least a couple of  hours .If one wants to just witness and document the process , she need not stand in a queue .The process of sacrifice used to come to a halt between 1200 and 1300 to clean kilo litres of blood on the idol and the floor .The gory  experience is not for any feint hearted human being ."
126,Dakshinkali Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Must visit for Hindu's,Goddess Kali is an incarnation of Mother Goddess Durga in Hindu mythology and is the destroyer of all evil.Very powerful and if you pray to her then bad elements of your life can be removed.
127,Dakshinkali Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Worship place of Hindu's goddess Kali,Its located a little bit out from main city. All the hindus from all over nepal came here to worship for their good times
128,Dakshinkali Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Not amazing but I enjoyed it,"The road o the temple is really bumpy so get a 4x4! There is a walkway down to the temple lined with stalls selling flowers, spices and chickens! The temple itself is small but of great religious importance. I also climbed up the hill to a small shrine."
129,Dakshinkali Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,"Live,crowdy and dirty",This temple was very populous and very dirty . On the other hand it was full of local worshipers. You had the feeling that people consider the temple sacre and special. In architectural terms there was not something particular to remember. It worths a visit just to see how Nepalese behave in their temples.
130,Budhanilkantha,Religious Sites,4.5,Peace of ming,One of the acient holy place in the bed of National park. It has National park in one side while you see whole kathmandu vally on the other side. If you are Hindu than this must be the place to be visited
131,Budhanilkantha,Religious Sites,4.5,A divine place,"Located on the outskirts of Katmandu city, this place is also known as Jal Narayan. The temple hosts Lord Vishnu in the sleeping posture inside a pond. The uniqueness of the statue is that Vishnu is resting on his back on the serpant Adishesha rather than on his palm and sleeping side ways. The place has a special aura and is very calm and peaceful."
132,Budhanilkantha,Religious Sites,4.5,Couldnt get close to the main area within the temple. It was locked.,Its kinda nice there. I was there while on my way to the hills and was there again at the evening on my way back. The place and surrounding area looked quite charming with all the lights. Theres a evening bazaar too I think.
133,Budhanilkantha,Religious Sites,4.5,Napal,"A must visit for Lord Vishnu devotees which encompasses Hindus and Buddhists. The name might not directly related to Lord Vishnu or Lord Narayana , but the image is definitely Lord Vishnu."
134,Budhanilkantha,Religious Sites,4.5,hail lord vishnu,amazing temple. Vishnu ji lying on an invisible sheshnaag. very clean. all the pundits are young boys. a must visit place for hindus.
135,Budhanilkantha,Religious Sites,4.5,Jal Sayana Narayana Temple,"About 10 km form the capital city of Kathmandu, the temple of Budhanilkanta temple  can be found. There is nothing connected to Bhudhism here. Bhudha Nilkanta is said to mean the Old Bluethroated God. Again another confustion in the name. Usually the name Nilkanta is attributed to Lord Shiva - but is a temple of Lord Vishnu.Nevertheless the Budhists also visit temple to offer prayers here. And the Saivaits claim that claim a reclining image of Shiva can be seen under the waters of the lake during the annual Shiva festival there in August. These apart, the temple a beautiful one attracting thousands of pilgrims round the year. The 5m  reclining Vishnu on the Athisesha in a pool of more than 10m is a great awesome site. People can offer worship from the padam side .A must visit in Nepal."
136,Budhanilkantha,Religious Sites,4.5,Jai narayana,"Jai narayana, jai budhanilakatha , jai bishnunath One of the peace place to hangout. and great views of scenarios"
137,Budhanilkantha,Religious Sites,4.5,The Sleeping Vishnu Temple,A very interesting open air temple containing the carved stone figure of the sleeping Lord Vishnu. It is a very large stone carving in a deep pool and the Lord Vishnu is revered by thousands of visiting Hindus each year
138,Budhanilkantha,Religious Sites,4.5,sleeping god,just off the location but very good for the all hindus. environment was so good and Shivapuri jungle is incredible
139,Budhanilkantha,Religious Sites,4.5,'Divine Presence on Earth',"There is nothing on the surface of this earth that humans created better and perfect that this stone statue of Jalasayana Vishnu or Narayana. If you want to be entranced or transported, please be there at 07:15 AM. If you miss this you did not see Nepal."
140,Hanuman Dhoka,�Architectural Buildings,4.5,Beautiful architecture Courtyard of Kathmandu,"Alot got get from Hanuman Gate, which is located on the west side of Durbar Square or Basantapur durbar square."
141,Hanuman Dhoka,�Architectural Buildings,4.5,best place to visit,"this is very old place ,here is many old temple and old royal palace.i go there to visit temlpe and big old royal palace"
142,Hanuman Dhoka,�Architectural Buildings,4.5,Beautiful history of Kathmandu,This was a great visit and one that i'll always remember when i visited in November 2016.  The temples are incredible and you'll be privileged to see cremations and other ceremonies taking place.  A must do on any visit to Kathmandu.
143,Hanuman Dhoka,�Architectural Buildings,4.5,Worth seeing,As it is under rebuild because of the earthquake you can not go in many of the sites but it is worth going to see what an earthquake can do
144,Hanuman Dhoka,�Architectural Buildings,4.5,darbar sq place,famous darbar sq place. a lot of animals are sacrificed during the Dashain festival. surrounded by many temple and historical places.
145,Hanuman Dhoka,�Architectural Buildings,4.5,world heritage site,"world heritage site with full of cultures adopted by ethnic Newars. It has several temples and a Malla Dynasty Palace. Besides, one temple has sculptures of sex postures showing the Tantra and spiritual techniques."
146,Hanuman Dhoka,�Architectural Buildings,4.5,'Royalty and Beauty',Do allocate half a day in this area not only to see but all to feel the energy and beauty of this mediaeval palace square. Nothing can parallel this place.
147,Hanuman Dhoka,�Architectural Buildings,4.5,Great architecture to see,The old temple buildings are much more interesting than the new Stoupas in my opinion. There are wood and stone carvings that are very elaborate. A good guide can explain them all to you.
148,Hanuman Dhoka,�Architectural Buildings,4.5,Need a guide,"Its really easy to run around snapping photos of all you survey but to get any type of contract you need to get a decent registered guide, its cheap and will at least tell you what you are taking pictures of."
149,Hanuman Dhoka,�Architectural Buildings,4.5,Must see,"The square is the complex of palaces, courtyards and temples. The square has amazing architecture. Feel like you have been thrown back in time. Visit the Kumari Ghar and to get to see the Living Goddess. I would recommend to visit this place with guide because you could miss something."
150,The Crematoria,Religious Sites,4,"One of the ""must see"" sights of KTM.","Despite having a vague sense of being a voyeur, one gets to see a significant aspect of Hindu culture acted out in real time ... the inevitable passage from this life, complete with rituals, ceremonies, and grief."
151,The Crematoria,Religious Sites,4,Humbling Experience,"It is difficult to describe the experience here because it is so very different from anything I have ever witnessed.  On the one hand, it feels as though the onlookers are intruding on one of the most precious and personal life eventsthe end of life.  It is heartbreaking to witness another persons grief so openly.  And on the other hand, I found myself curious and engrossed with a ritual so different from anything I have known.  The reverence which the family provides to the deceased family member from the ceremonial washing of the body, to the placement of colorful shrouds on the body, the wrapping of the body in the white garment and the ritual of the placement of the body on its final resting place.  There was a bit of a sense of being honored to bear witness to this life event."
152,The Crematoria,Religious Sites,4,Zist of life,"This is the place where you can reliase yourself. makes you feel about the prospect of life..  People rush, greed , fear and always different emotions. and finally leave the soil. They remain as memory. This place makes them feel what is the motto of life."
153,The Crematoria,Religious Sites,4,Impactful,This is not a choice tourist choice. Witnessing funeral customs is informative but not probably the first choice when travelling with children. We spent some time here as part of the temple visit.
154,The Crematoria,Religious Sites,4,Watch the bodies burning,"I wasn't sure how close we would be to the bodies burning when I went to visit, but as soon as I walked down by the river I looked over at the wood pile closest to me and about 2 metres away was a dead body of an old lady. It was confronting for a moment, but then as I sat and watched the bodies it felt very natural to have the process of death and burning happening in the open by the rives and the temple. I really recommend visiting and reflecting for a while here."
155,The Crematoria,Religious Sites,4,Like a phoenix...,"Nepalese believe in rebirth. Being burned in this sacred place is the key to a successful rebirth.Interesting place. But at the same time, it's a sad place."
156,The Crematoria,Religious Sites,4,WOW,"Very interesting to see, especially for a Westerner. this is a piece of culture not seen in my part of the world."
157,The Crematoria,Religious Sites,4,A must place to visit,"I come here every time I come through Nepal. Always different, always interesting and contemplative. Fewer holy men now that there are no tourists..."
158,The Crematoria,Religious Sites,4,"The culture, history and people - AMAZING","This is where you go to be a fly on the wall when a culture shares is nature, belief's, and soul.   Could have just observed life here for an entire day."
159,The Crematoria,Religious Sites,4,A must,"A must. Never seen anything like this before.  Very good to see a lifetime experience.  Listen, smell and look."
160,Kumari Chowk,Religious Sites,4,Beautiful,"A silent place inside Basantapur, a Beautiful place to get a chance to get a glimpse of living goddess Kumari"
161,Kumari Chowk,Religious Sites,4,Nice carved work,"You can not bypass the the Kumari Bahal or House off the Living Goddess,  carved windows and doors guarded by stone lions are the sign. It is possible to enter the courtyard at some hours to see magnificent wooden balconies, taking pictures of goddess is not allowed, possible to take pics when she is not presented. I had just chance to take a glimpse of the courtyard as I walked in at the time it was closed. Be advised tat Westerns are not allowed to go beyond the courtyard area."
162,Kumari Chowk,Religious Sites,4,Napal,The intricate carvings can be seen throughout the inner courtyard. Lover of fine art and mythology can spend hours appreciating the delicate beauty of century old craftsmanship.
163,Kumari Chowk,Religious Sites,4,Close Around Thamel,Rich history and ancient house gives much value to this place. I most say this place have kind of specialities . agree or not this is one most to visit and know the culture
164,Kumari Chowk,Religious Sites,4,A Lovely Palace for Nepal's Royal Living Goddess,"The Kumari Chowk (Kumari Ghar) is a red-colored royal palace located in Kathmandu's Durbar Square.  This ""Palace"" is still the residence of the current ""Living Goddess"" of Kathmandu, and she resides on the upper levels of the Palace.  The lower level of the building is open for tourists to visit and marvel at the architecture.According to Wikipedia, the Nepal Kumari or Living Goddess is a very young prepubescent girl selected from the Shakya caste or Bajracharya clan of the Nepalese Newari Buddhist community.   The Royal Kumari of Kathmandu must go through a very rigorous selection process before being selected.The Palace building itself is visually quite stunning, and it appears that much of the building has already been renovated on the front facade.  However, on the interior courtyard area, there are still some wall support braces visible until the restoration is complete.Overall, the Palace is definitely a worthwhile place to visit since it is also located in the UNESCO World Heritage site of Durbar Square."
165,Kumari Chowk,Religious Sites,4,living goddess,overhyped and touristic trap. nothing to see other than hearing some stories of captivating and child as a goddess. did not like it. though the surrounding places r nice in the darbar square.
166,Kumari Chowk,Religious Sites,4,Living goddess residence,"This ancient building houses the six year old living goddess revered by the people of Nepal. The kumari is carried whenever she leaves the building several times a year for religious ceremonies. She always wears red clothing.  Each kumari is chosen based on 32 characteristics of physical perfection plus her horoscope.  Once the child is accepted she remains indoors at all times except for religious ceremonies.  Occasionally, she will briefly appear at the upper window.  Pictures of her are strictly forbidden.  We saw a crowd gathering in the small courtyard so we waited and around 11:00, she came to the window.  She just looked in one direction for about 10 seconds and left.  An interesting book to read entails a former kumari talking about her experience.  Seemed like a lonely life for such a small child."
167,Kumari Chowk,Religious Sites,4,'Living Gddess in Human Body',"Only after having visited here and observed the reverence of the locals, you can understand what Kumari represents for the locals. !2:00 noon-16:00 hrs, it remains closed."
168,Kumari Chowk,Religious Sites,4,We Saw The Kumari,"With mixed opinions, we visited the Chowk and arrived just before Kumari made an appearance at the window.  It sparked many questions and discussions about this controversial spiritual figure."
169,Kumari Chowk,Religious Sites,4,you must be lucky,"A little girl lives here as a living goddess. If she is willing, she shows herself to the public from the upper story of this house, so you just may be lucky. Nice historic building."
170,Narayanhiti Palace Museum,Speciality Museums,4,An interesting view into royal lifestyle,"After Nepal transformed into a republic from a monarchy, the erstwhile royal palace has been converted into a museum. It shows a fascinating glimpse into the daily life of the royal family and is very well curated. You can visit the site of the massacre which wiped out the royal family and also see the royal gardens and garage."
171,Narayanhiti Palace Museum,Speciality Museums,4,A really interesting place to spend a few hours,I thought this place was super cool! Its a snapshot in time how the Royals entertained and how they lived. It seems like they lived in their personal quarters a lot more humbly than we would think. But its an incredible place and well sign posted. I thought the highlight would be to see where the horrible massacre took place but that was really just a sidebar. I found where they entertained and lived a whole lot more interesting
172,Narayanhiti Palace Museum,Speciality Museums,4,Nepal Royal Family Palace Tour,"A Kathmandu shopkeeper suggested we go and visit this palace, and we were glad that we did.  This tour, plus the book Massacre At The Palace by J Gregson (we plan to read soon!) will give the traveler a history of the Nepal Royal Family and their 2001 tragedy.  We enjoyed the tour - it was surprisingly long and thorough with signs in English."
173,Narayanhiti Palace Museum,Speciality Museums,4,Worth a visit - once.,"More to it than I'd thought. Decaying 60s/70s grandeur if you can imagine such a thing. I thought the site of the royal massacre could have been tidied up a bit, but perhaps the fact that it has been neglected reflects something of the legacy. Took me about 90 mins to go round. Could do with more signage/explanation. An opportunity to buy postcards or something would be good as you are not able to take photos."
174,Narayanhiti Palace Museum,Speciality Museums,4,Beautiful palace,Our king living in so simple. Love to see this place in conservation. Feeling good and missing king Birendra and his family
175,Narayanhiti Palace Museum,Speciality Museums,4,Fascinating!,"Absolutely Fascinating! It feels like walking through the history of Shah dynasty of Nepal. Everything is mighty inside the palace, it makes you seem royal. Larger than life pictures and paintings of Royals of Nepal to feel their might, and lots and lots of mirrors to humble you down; can be found on every place you look. It may not seem so but it is LARGE! You tire yourself walking through each and every part of the museum and I encourage you to do so if you want the best experience. The staffs are eager to teach you about the significance of the things there and the whole place as a whole. They are very friendly and respectful. While the place itself takes your breath away; the friendly staffs are not an aspect to be ignored. And don't forget to look for the bullet holes!"
176,Narayanhiti Palace Museum,Speciality Museums,4,Palace of King .,Surprisingly interesting place to see where so much history has taken place. It shows various rooms where the king and his visitors Stayed as well as the site of the massacre. There is explanation in English too off the rooms. You do have to check phones and cameras too but that was very quick and safe. Only down side was they could do with a bit more history about the family etc
177,Narayanhiti Palace Museum,Speciality Museums,4,A memorable place,"After the inside visit of the Narayanhiti Palace, it makes you think of another way of living of the King and Queen at that time."
178,Narayanhiti Palace Museum,Speciality Museums,4,just in memory,"it was very good to see all the old monument of the Royal Kingdom of Nepal. Also very sad to know about the Royal Massacre in 2001. But, the preservation of the museum is good"
179,Narayanhiti Palace Museum,Speciality Museums,4,'Reminder of History',Remains and recollection of Saha Royalty with and the kingship that was in Nepal for some centuries. One of the places to visit.
180,Babar Mahal Revisted,Architectural Buildings,4.5,You have to visit this place,"This place is insane!staff, food accommodation perfekt, quite and cosy! The hotel is located in a old palace wich is perfectly restored! You have to visit this place"
181,Babar Mahal Revisted,Architectural Buildings,4.5,Gorgeous and definitely worth a tour.,Will take half a day if that and is a lovely escape from the bustle of Kathmandu. Several eateries on site and a place to get your bespoke and quality items.
182,Babar Mahal Revisted,Architectural Buildings,4.5,Babur Mahal,Charming place to walk around. Interesting shops with an interesting variety but expensive. Small hotel in the premises too.
183,Babar Mahal Revisted,Architectural Buildings,4.5,Nice galleries and shops,Had dinner with small tastes of Nepalese food. Watched dancers while we ate. Each dance was explained.
184,Babar Mahal Revisted,Architectural Buildings,4.5,An oasis amongst history,"My husband and I wanted a quiet timeout of our busy lives and schedule. We were treated very generously and with friendly gestures, and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this historic setting."
185,Babar Mahal Revisted,Architectural Buildings,4.5,Babar Mahal Revisited,Perfect place for family in peaceful environment with good food. Babar Mahal Revisited is historical old durbar which is really nice.
186,Babar Mahal Revisted,Architectural Buildings,4.5,Upscale Serenity,"We went for the Siddhartha Art Gallery and found a wonderful quiet respite. This is a Place that was previously occupied by Maharajahs from Jaipur that has been repurposed into a boutique hotel, two very nice restaurants and a plethora of shops featuring handmade goods.  There are a number of plaques that document the history."
187,Babar Mahal Revisted,Architectural Buildings,4.5,Expensive...,"The stores are very expensive, and the products are not particularly distinctive - certainly didnt feel that the quality of what was on offer warranted the price tags. Didnt really feel it was worth the trip. There were some stores that sold products produced by local artisans/artists but only one of these (an actual art exhibit by a local artist) was of any real quality - the others felt quite generic and overpriced. Very underwhelmed."
188,Babar Mahal Revisted,Architectural Buildings,4.5,Superb hotel and resturant,The food is outstanding and very lively place. Momos were superb. Garlic bread was outstanding. Superb place to stay. Second best after dwarika.
189,Babar Mahal Revisted,Architectural Buildings,4.5,"Love this beautiful, quaint establishment","It's like playing hide and seek in a collonial castle with pretty shops to choose. Ramalaya and Himalayan Atelier are my favorites. There's also a nice French bistro to spend your afternoon. Don;t miss the place, you'll love it!"
190,Basantapur Tower,Lookouts,4.5,chill place,"Best place to visit in Kathmandu, One of the world heritage sites you must visit along with 2 other durbar squares."

192,Basantapur Tower,Lookouts,4.5,old and classic,The architecture of basantapur is very historic and finely crafted. The place has old woody fragrance and can see lots of pigeons  and monkey. The tea of different species and herbs are really fashion. Its not clean all the time and doesn't require any tickets.
193,Basantapur Tower,Lookouts,4.5,Underwhelming,"East Asian architecture is so bland and underwhelming when compared to Ottoman architecture, European Architecture and Turkic-Iranian architecture.  Blah. Also the filth of Durbar Square adds to the ugliness."
194,Basantapur Tower,Lookouts,4.5,A nice to see the old architectures,The old architectures bring you to the past and give us a little idea how people were at that time and their mode of living too.

200,Phulchowki,Mountains,4.5,"Crazy 1st day, better 2nd visit","We went to the hill for bird-watching, unfortunately the first day the local TV station announced that Snow was on the Mountain resulting in what seemed half the motorbikes in the city trying to climb the hill over the morning basically scaring any and all birdlife away. The second day however saw the crowds disappear allowing more of the promised range and variety of bird-life to appear resulting in a much more pleasant experience...certainly a place to recommend for both exercise and a more relaxed option if in Katmandhu and interested in wildlife."
201,Phulchowki,Mountains,4.5,Breathtaking view; pristine forest,"Phulchowki is the tallest hill around Kathmandu, during winter its covered in snow and even in summer its cool up there. The top is gurded by Nepalese Army yet you can go inside to see the tower and goddess Phulchowki. The top has lava rock on strange formation. You can see Kathmandu from Eagles eye and other surrounding places and mountains, Its 2700 Meters high from sea level Going there is also fun as you can drive/walk uphill through thick and untouched forest listening to birds. During spring Rhododendron blooms here coloring parts of hill cherry red.   TIP:Carry your water if you plan to hike, its going to take 3-4 hours to reach top if you are a good walker. On the top Army have a canteen where you can buy tea(black) or ask them to make you noodles, eggs etc. Its pretty small canteen. Stay within the walking tracks/road, people have been lost here and finding a lost person is difficult as its thick forest. Wild animals such as black bears, leopards live here though attacks on human are not recorded."

Once is not enough for this beautiful place."

206,Phulchowki,Mountains,4.5,Best view point near Kathmandu,"Beautiful panaromic view of Himalayas and lush green forest will refresh anybody visiting this place. Guarded by Nepalese army, there is a tower at the top of hill from where surrounding areas and High Himalayas far away can be seen like a bird. Recommended for those who wish to see Himalayas even from distant."
207,Phulchowki,Mountains,4.5,Wonderful,Phulchauki is the highest point of Kathmandu providing some great Himalayan views. Very difficult to take off your eyes off from the beauty
208,Phulchowki,Mountains,4.5,Phulchock in Kathmandu,I have been to Phulchock many times in the past. It was great to revisit the place. There have been few changes after the earth quack three years back.

213,Budhanilakantha Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Visit to Budhanilkantha Temple,This temple is unique in itself.  One has to climb down several steps in a well and starts the cave where the deity is sitting. It is also unique that it has Sheshashahi Vishnu stone idol in a sleeping position on a Naag. (Kobra) All in a small water tank. The temple is quite clean and one needs to adhere to visiting timings and pay entrance ticket. But this is worth a visit for its uniqueness.
214,Budhanilakantha Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Budhanilakantha temple,budhanilakantha temple is situated about 10 kms from main city. Lord Vishnu in Sayana position in this temple.We are informed by the guide that one old man by name Nilakantha found the deity and hence the temple is named as Budha(old)Nilakantha temple.
215,Budhanilakantha Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Unbelievable and Amazing Place,This place is not very popular amongst the tourist as it has never been talked about as one of the places to see in Nepal on websites or govt advertisements. But this place is unique as it has a floating Hindu God Vishnu Ji in water. There is no other Temple of Vishnu Ji in the world in this form and posture. Seeing is believing. One must visit this place on the foothills of Shivapuri Mountain.

218,Budhanilakantha Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,A peaceful place to experience Nepalese rituals,"This place was close to my resort. I went there thrice with different companions. First time when I went there was some kinda festivals going on. Women were wearing red sarees & performing rituals. The big red building in the yard provides an age old vibe. The lying idol is a unique masterpiece to be observed. Since it's a holy place, moderate clothing & staying in limits are mandatory. It's an uphill place,So you should be conscious about your breathing."
219,Budhanilakantha Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Wonderful vacation,This time we are in katmandu for our family vacation and we are so fortune to visit this holy temple we heard but this time we are  get a chance to visit this beautiful temple and we are feel so fortunate and feel good
220,Pullahari Monastery,Religious Sites,4.5,Nice decorated monastery in an awesome and stunning environment,Visiting this monastery gives you a nice impression of the well decorated interior of this traditional building. Also interesting to watch daily life of the monks.
221,Pullahari Monastery,Religious Sites,4.5,Panoramic views and great cafe,"It is hard to believe that just a 15 minute drive from the chaos and dust of busy Boudha, an oasis of peace and calm and beauty can be found so close to the city. You can walk to Pullahari Monastery from Boudha or get a taxi up and walk back. The beauty of Pullahari Monastery is that it is open to the public and welcomes visitors - both locals and tourists. Opening hours are from around 10 am to 4pm each days. The temple itself may not be open but there is plenty to see and it has the best caf run by the monks with the tastiest samosas in the whole of Kathmandu. The caf also serves cakes and snacks, hot and cold drinks and all food is made fresh there.  For tourists it is worth a visit as it gives you 360 degree panoramic views around the Kathmandu Valley and across to all the hills. From the top temple you get a really good idea of the lay of the land of Kathmandu and how crowded it is. From Pullahari you can also do the 40 minute walk along the ridge line to Kopan Monastery - a wonderful mini trek through the trees and jungle to give you a taste of trekking in Nepal. From Kopan you can get a taxi back to town or walk back to Boudha. A great place for a half day outing or you can just spend hours sitting in the beautiful gardens around the monastery and relax."
222,Pullahari Monastery,Religious Sites,4.5,Peaceful Monastery in the Hills,"Nice visit to this picturesque, peaceful monastery.  Nice gardens and also a walkway among more than half a dozen stupas down the hillside.  We were invited inside the main temple for prayers.  Not as extraordinary as the nearby hilltop Amitabha Monastery."
223,Pullahari Monastery,Religious Sites,4.5,Nice non-commercial monastery to visit,"I see from reading other reviews that people are very emotional about this place with all the superlatives. But its only a Tibetan Buddhist monastery as it should be, and with beautiful views of the surrounding area. It's also a pleasant walk and a welcome change from Kopan if you are staying there. The main gompa renovation seems to be done and the paintings are amazing. If you walked there you will love resting at the caf with very reasonable prices (half of those of Kopan) and also great views from the upper terrace."
224,Pullahari Monastery,Religious Sites,4.5,"Great ambience, incredible place","Its a beautiful place near by Gokarna. The monasteries are full of amazing art, surrounded by greenery.

225,Pullahari Monastery,Religious Sites,4.5,Magical monastery,This monastery was great; even though it was under construction at the time we visited it was beautiful and impressive. We witnessedthe evening prayer and loved it.
226,Pullahari Monastery,Religious Sites,4.5,"Peaceful, glorious gardens and great views","These days life in Kathmandu can be chaotic with traffic jams, pollution and crowds of people.  But just half an hour's walk from Boudha, the magnificent Pullahari Monastery gives you peace and quite, fantastic views across Kathmandu Valley, great views of the big hills behind and it has the best tea house and samosas in the area. You can get to Pullahari by taxi, local bus or walk up the hill and enjoy the countryside. Saturdays are very busy there as all the local young people like to go there to relax and enjoy snacks at the caf. If you time it right you may be there when one of the big prayer ceremonies are on and it is so special to hear the sounds chanting and drums, horns and cymbals. Pullahari was badly damaged in the quakes and the main temple has just opened again after reconstruction. The most awe inspiring sight is watching artists painting the wall frescos and Buddhist imagery on the monastery walls - hundreds of hours of work to achieve such beauty and detail.  Rai at the caf makes the best samosas in Kathmandu and you can enjoy them there along with other home made goodies or he will pack them for take away.  You can even stay at Pullahari so enquire at the office as they have some arrangements for five day or more stays in the cottages below the monastery. One of our favourite places in the whole of Kathmandu - Pullahari is highly recommended for a visit. From there you can do the half hour walk along a well made path around the ridge to Kopan Monastery."
227,Pullahari Monastery,Religious Sites,4.5,Less Tourists,The monastery is not really famous with the tourists. Our hotel front desk informed us about the place. Can be visited if you have few hours to spare.
228,Pullahari Monastery,Religious Sites,4.5,Peaceful spiritual place,"Every time I visit Kathmandu I visit the Monastery and feel the positive peace within .The Monastery is located on a hill above the Boudhanath area on the same ridge as Kopan Monastery, just a few minutes walk away from Kopan Monastery.Very good place to go and  take  relax, meditate, and enjoy with family.Fantastic place."
229,Pullahari Monastery,Religious Sites,4.5,A secret hideaway on a hill overlooking the city,"A beautiful monastery set on top of a hill in Southern Kathmandu, the view is breathtaking, so is the monastery. The gardens are lovely. A lovely place to meditate and get fresh air. You should also try out the fresh cakes, samosas, lafings and pakodas available at the canteen. Reasonable price and clean. Vegetarian. We visit the place again and again. It's also a good idea to walk from the Gokarna temple, a lovely 30-minute hike."
230,National Botanical Gardens,Gardens,4,wonderful place for plants loving people!,"After passing the difficulty of finding the entrance we had a wonderful experience in the garden. If you are interested in plants, in their use for local people and in their variety this is teh place for you to go! It is amazing in what variable climates, heights, etc. plants can live and with which startegies. The garden describes the distribution of Nepali plants, their range, their strategies and their beauty quite well."

234,National Botanical Gardens,Gardens,4,Wonderful sanctuary.,"A beautiful surprise to us. Well kept and interesting, with lots of bird life. Well worth a visit and not far from the city."
235,National Botanical Gardens,Gardens,4,Peaceful and Informative,The display on Nepal's indigenous healing and industrial-use plants was great. A lot of the specimens however seemed dead in that exhibit (Maybe because they were mountaing growing plants). Nonetheless the placards were informative. The greenhouses were closed to the public when I went but the grounds were pleasant to walk. It was a great break from the hustle and bustle of Kathmandu.
236,National Botanical Gardens,Gardens,4,Nice,National Botanical Gardens is very nice place to spend time amidst nature. It is quite well maintained with beautiful flowers grown all around
237,National Botanical Gardens,Gardens,4,lovely large gardens for a peaceful park walk,"A lovely tranquil spot for a walk or just to sit and reflect or read a book in the fresh air. Its about a 30-40 min drive from the centre of Kathmandu but easy to find, just past the Godvari post office on the way to Pulchowki hill. The entry fee is a nominal 226 ruppees (or about 2 US dollars) for foreigners. Well worth the money to support the work they are doing and the preservation of one of the few park spaces in kathmandu. Plants are clearly labelled for the curious or scientifically minded. Many beautiful flowers for those who just like to admire the beauty. Set against the hills on the edge of the valley, it is a welcome place to breathe fresh air and soak up the greenery. There is a restaurant on site."
238,National Botanical Gardens,Gardens,4,Peaceful Getaway from Kathmandu,"My husband and I wanted a day trip out of the city and this place was great. Large and peaceful, even romantic.

244,Jaganath(Krishna) Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Krishna temple,Situated in Durbar square near hanuman dhoka. Hindu people pay homage at this site.it is two storey temple and ancient.
245,Jaganath(Krishna) Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Krishna Temple on a Shiva City,"The story goes that the king wanted to make a Shiva temple and have the deity installed on the second floor. One night in his dreams, Krishna came and asked him to make a Krishna temple. So he decided to have Radha & Krishna on the first floor. All the Desa Avatar of Vishnu are sculptured around on the same floor."
246,Jaganath(Krishna) Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,not a must see but wish for luck while there,we were very lucky to arrive at the attraction while a funeral was taking time. we could see the whole rituals and ceremony that we used to see in films only.i would recommend it would you wish to discover another culture
247,Jaganath(Krishna) Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Optional,"It is not a must, but could be part of a sightseeing plan.If you have time go see it, but do not expect a lot"

249,Jaganath(Krishna) Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,"Gorgeous building, must see part of Durbar Square tour","Not too damaged by the earthquake, fun to see a Krishna temple here in the land of Buddhism. Beautiful architecture; a must see."
250,Indra Chowk,Historic Walking Areas,4,full of hustle and bustle,this busy market area was filled with loads of interesting shops and restaurants. The Lassi Shop and the Samosa Shop called TipTop were the highlights of the area. The Lassi shop sells the best Lassi i have ever tasted.
251,Indra Chowk,Historic Walking Areas,4,Best of Nepal.,"If you are in Kathmandu, don't miss this place to visit, as it is a color market near Thamel. if you are in Nepal to explore real authentic things then Indra Chok is the one you should go and explore. good luck.I had a guide from safe holiday adventure from Kathmandu, he helped me a lot and gave info about that places, if you are looking for a guide also to visit Indra chok then i would say the contract with safe holiday adventure pvt. ltd or mr.gauli santosh. have a great time enjoy."
252,Indra Chowk,Historic Walking Areas,4,Rich of culture,"This is our Nepal's Pride. Various type of culture, religious are one of the ornament of Kathmandu valley."
253,Indra Chowk,Historic Walking Areas,4,Busy shopping street!!!,"This is a busy shopping district adjacent to Kathmandu Durbar Square. It is very busy crowded with people, cars and motorbikes. It is a good place to taste the life of locals in Kathmandu where we could see different vendors selling wide range of stuffs. In our opinion, it is not a conducive place to do shopping since it is busy and chaotic. We were there just to feel the local livelihoods as part of city life in Kathmandu, so it is perfectly fine for us. Suggest to walk to this place since the road is extremely congested. It is walkable from Thamel district on the way to Durbar Square. Not difficult to navigate using Google Map if you purchase the prepaid data SIM card at the airport with fees of NPR800 for 5GB valid for 28 days."
254,Indra Chowk,Historic Walking Areas,4,Local market,"Few tourists come here compared to Thamel. Prices are still automatically jacked up when they see a foreigner so you have to bargain hard to come close to a decent price which gets old really quickly. But the place is well worth a trip. It is located in the old part of town and it is surrounded by gorgeous temples. Locals come here to buy in mass especially on Saturdays. Youll find everything from fabrics to copper and brass houseware. Cheap jewelry, incense, etc."
255,Indra Chowk,Historic Walking Areas,4,Funny place of katmandu,"Really nice place base in the middle of a noise square. You can buy lots of cloths from different colours. The best is to get on the middle of the square, you have to cross a really crowdy street but you will survive.I recommend the place because you can find really good staff but remember they give you a price, bargain for it"
256,Indra Chowk,Historic Walking Areas,4,Downtown of Nepal,"One can find Nepali culture well carved in windows of buildings, not only in the temples but also in private houses. It is a point of attraction not only for tourists but also that it is a centre of market of traditional ornaments, apparels. If you are buying something, be careful to select the genuine items from artificial ones and do not forget to bargain."
257,Indra Chowk,Historic Walking Areas,4,Don't just rush through here!,"This is my favorite place to take in urban Kathmandu. From my perch on the temple steps I often see tourists scurrying through on their way from Thamel  to Kathmandu Durbar Square. Hey! This town is more than just the monuments! Stop and just exlore the maze of streets slightly to the north and west. Face the temple with the flyign dogs ... to the right is the street where about two dozen shops sell applique along with tika, paranda and bangles.go slightly to the north and get a lassi, hang out with the Nepalis for just a minute. The Rato Mechhandranath temple is half a block away.There is a small shop to buy Haku Patasi and other traditional fabric, nearby named ""Nepal Kasaa Pasal"" if you Google it you can find a longer blog I wrote about it.And of course, the bead bazaar. If you are into photographic this is one of the best stops you can make!"
258,Indra Chowk,Historic Walking Areas,4,An amazing heritage walk in old Kathmandu!,"Indrachowk is in the heart of old Kathmandu city and just 5 minutes walk from Kathmandu Durbar Square.It is the commercial hub of the old city and the local market is colorful,crowded and vibrant.It sells all possible things but it is just interesting to walk through it to enjoy the experience.Indrachowk area has temples and traditional stores that are unique.If you enjoy walking through a market then you'll love it.It also has a unique ""Pote"" bazaar.Pote are beads worn by married hindu women and made by muslims.Not too far is Machindra bahal temple,worshipped by Hindus and Buddhists.Further on is the Annapurna temple and Ason chowk.One can continue walking through Tyoda and Thahiti and reach Thamel.The whole walk can be done in an hour but it is recommended that you stop,explore and enjoy the walk.If you want a completely different atmosphere and a more local ambience then visit the area in the early morning when the vendors are selling vegetables and fruits."
259,Indra Chowk,Historic Walking Areas,4,fun inner city market place,Fun to see all the wares set up for sale in this big open market space. Don't forget to bargain as you enjoy the Nepalese tourist lures.
260,Kathesimbu Stupa,Religious Sites,4.5,A must,"Incredible, lots of stairs ..so be fit, there is a hand rail but still very hard climb ......it is worth it , incredible view ,love the pray wheels ...make sure you go the ring way ....right to left you spin them ...."
261,Kathesimbu Stupa,Religious Sites,4.5,Good for praying and appreciation,"Visited 2 times when walk toward Durbar square.  It was not planned to look for it, but you will instantly spot it when pass by, because of the blue sky, spiritual stupa, chill wind to away from the busy road.Do sit down and have local sweet milk tea at the alley, very spiritual place and blessed.Of course, do visit the monk school and the prayer wheel."
262,Kathesimbu Stupa,Religious Sites,4.5,Mini Stupa,"A nice place to visit if youre strolling around Kathmandu. It has a miniature version of Boudhastupa. However, be careful of bird poop as this place is packed with pigeons!"
263,Kathesimbu Stupa,Religious Sites,4.5,Another must-see,"Make this one of your stops while in Kathmandu.  I know it is considered touristy, but some things are that way for a reason."
264,Kathesimbu Stupa,Religious Sites,4.5,Mini stupa and colourful temple architecture,"I stumbled upon this stupa by accident, on my way to Asan Tole (spice street) and Kathmandus Durban Square. It was on the right, heading south.The small courtyard was quiet, just a thousand pigeons eating corn and pooping everywhere. Opposite the chaitya (small stupa), was a very lovely wooden, carved painted door with golden script above, and this was a Tibetan style monastery (closed when I visited). It took me ages to find the name of this place, but then I could read about it. Its a 17th copy of the big Swayambhu stupa.Hope you find it!"
265,Kathesimbu Stupa,Religious Sites,4.5,Mini Swayambu,"I love this little square with its stupa and monastery. Not so many tourists seem to find it, so it is more a place where locals hang out. There are quite a lot of pigeons, which can be a bit of a nuisance if children are running about (I got a lot of feathers in my paint)."
266,Kathesimbu Stupa,Religious Sites,4.5,Nive place and free entrance,"I truly recommend this place for two reason,the pagoda is really nice but if you get inside the budispt temple you will enjoy it.Secondly is a free temple and in katmandu almost all of them you need to pay entrance.Is another quite place from the city but is not one of the most cleanest temples. About the budispt temple, you can get inside without shoes and you can take pictures if the monks are not praying, I recommend to get inside is a relly nice place"
267,Kathesimbu Stupa,Religious Sites,4.5,Little bhoudanath,"Lovely find, our guide brought us here and at first look this is like mini Bhoudanath stupa, exactly. Its ver charming and has small shops and monastery nearby with very reasonable prices. Lots of locals visit not tourists, and near to Thamel just short walk of less than 10mins. Really enjoyed the calm serene sense despite being in a busy location."
268,Kathesimbu Stupa,Religious Sites,4.5,Worthwhile Stop,Most tourists stay in Thamel and find their way to Durbar Square. It's worth checking your walking path to the in this stupa and the surrounding Tibetan area--it's a better walk with less vehicle traffic and you can view the stup and monastery inside the square. There are also many shops in this area for Tibetan and Buddhist items with better chances at decent prices than you will get in Thamel.
269,Kathesimbu Stupa,Religious Sites,4.5,Beautiful place,"This is a short walk from Thamel, and the walk to this place itself is beautiful. Many interesting things to see along the way.This place is beautiful. The stupa and all the beautiful figurines and shrines."
270,Akash Bhairav Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Akash Bhairav,"Akash BhairavThe Aakash Bhairav temple at Indrachowk in Kathmandu is the residence of King Yalamber who is supposed to have achieved the power through tantric and is believed to be appearance of Lord Shiva, but like Banasura, he may possibly have been a disciple of lord Shiva.The Aakash Bhairav temple at Indrachowk in Kathmandu is the residence of King Yalamber who is supposed to have achieved the power through tantric and is believed to be appearance of Lord Shiva, but like Banasura, he may possibly have been a disciple of lord Shiva. Many such other add-ons are found in Nepali tradition of the story where Aakash Bhairav was involved in the Kurukshetra war. Akash Bhairav is a Hindu deity, regarded as the god of the sky, several large temples in Kathmandu are dedicated to him and also consider as a progenitor of the Maharjan caste, especially the peasant groups. Aakash Bhairav's head has an image that the Buddhists recognize as Buddha and the Hindus identify as Brahma, thus making the idol of Yalamber/Barbarika/Aakash Bhairav worship by everyone. The head of the Aakash Bhairav was excavated many hundred years ago in Kathmandu. The head now exists in a Hindu temple in Kathmandu which isnt far-off from Durbar Square. It is taken out of the temple once in every year and is blessed by the Kumari- the living goddess lives nearby Kumari Chowk. Worshipping of the Bhairav is generally a symbol of protection and power. For eight continuous days during the celebrations in Indrajatra festival, the temple contains of decorated temple and the deity. This is follow by the Tantrik Puja, the Sagun Puja and the Kal Puja. The worshipper and the deity are held together in an exceptionally 'reciprocal' energetic. Akash Bhairav symbolizes protection and goodwill for the nation and its people as per the belief by the Nepalese people.#storytelling #historyofkathmandu #indrachoknewroad #kathmandu #nepal #nepaldiaries"

274,Akash Bhairav Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Powerful God,My elders have a strong belief on Akash Bhairav and i have been visiting Akash Bhairav since a toddler.
275,Akash Bhairav Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Worth Visiting Inside,"Have passed this temple many times (among settings for movie Dr. Strange), but went inside for first time today. It is well worth it--peaceful refuge inside and beautiful."
276,Akash Bhairav Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Foreigners are allowed inside,Take off your shoes at the landing to the stairway. If you are quiet and respectful you can sit across from the icon and enjoy the puja while you look out the window. There are some veyr interesting metal sculptures in the main room.
277,Akash Bhairav Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Akash Bhairav tempel,Beautiful wooden carving. Take enough time to look at the details. Next time I will certainly see other details
278,Akash Bhairav Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Interesting Temple In A Busy Street & Square,"This was a busy and crowded part of Kathmandu and this old temple which apparently was supposed to have been the palace of the original  King of Nepal and a particlar religious sect.This was one of those places to look at the old architecture and watch the locals going about their daily routine,."
279,Akash Bhairav Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Sightseeing in Thamel,"Walking around early morning while the locals are busy selling & buying fresh vegetables to cloths, pots & pans! A sight for all senses"
280,Mandala Street,Neighborhoods,4.5,Nice street,"Despite other areas that are supposed to be traffic free this street actually is which is a relief . There are some cafes some decent shops and a decent place to meet people without getting hassled which I am doing tonight just for that reason as I dont want a taxi , hash or a massage or even a rickshaw ride ( honestly the hassle is fairly minor compared to many other places but hey ho )"
281,Mandala Street,Neighborhoods,4.5,"Great, quiet shopping away from Thamel chaoa","No cars are allowed, which makes for a less fumey, quiet and calmShopping or walking experience. I kept going back there and bringing others as the respite can be so needed in the chaos that is Thamel."
282,Mandala Street,Neighborhoods,4.5,A quiet oasis in the centre of Thamel.,"Mandala Street is a great little escape if you need a break from the busy streets of Thamel. With more boutique-type shops, no traffic or being hassled by store owners. This is a great spot to regather yourself with a meal or a drink."
283,Mandala Street,Neighborhoods,4.5,INTERESTING SHOPS,"A nice little Arcade of shops, and a couple of cafes to stop at for a rest while shopping in Thamel.."
284,Mandala Street,Neighborhoods,4.5,browsing the shops,very safe area to be out in. lots of different shops to browse. the 2 stories make for a look down on what is going on.
285,Mandala Street,Neighborhoods,4.5,Nice fake street,"I am Italian, well travelled and totally trustworthy.This is my 8th times I land in Kathmandu because of climbing...usually a walk through Thamel is mandatory fir smthg I need to buy.Mandala street is a really cool small street, but totally fake. I mean, its what we guys from Europe and the US have in mind thinking about the spiritual Asia: walls of cool shiny dark bricks, well paved, clean, with nice shops and employees well dressed and smiling...Thats not Thamel, thats not Kathmandu nor Nepal: that its dusty, dirty, smelly, with people spitting and throwing rubbish along the streets and the river. Trust me: take off the dirt from Nepal, and its 50% less interesting than it is.So go to Thamel, forget about Mandala street unless you hit on it (easy) and enjoy the real life."
286,Mandala Street,Neighborhoods,4.5,Quite a cool place,"Tucked deep in the Thamel area. The good bit is, is that there are no cars. Heaps of shops/traders and some excellent cafes. See if you can find the Cafe with no name. It is worth it :)"
287,Mandala Street,Neighborhoods,4.5,Worth a look,Mandala Street has some great shopping and hides the entrance to Himalayan Java which has some of the best coffee in Thamel. There is a good cashmere shop with high quality goods as well. If you want a good strong take away coffee the little coffee shop on the corner does great coffee as well.
288,Mandala Street,Neighborhoods,4.5,Vibrant tourist area,"This is one of the key streets of the tourist shopping area. Lots of shops, many selling the same things - you just have to make your choice and then remember to bargain hard, even if it doesnt come naturally!"
289,Mandala Street,Neighborhoods,4.5,Tourist Market,A Walking street through Thamel. Different types of clothes and artificial stones and jewellery are sold here. It caters particularly for foreign tourists. Coffee and other western types of eating joints are lined up on the street and if goes in night then sparkling  with light mesmerising you.
290,Sankhu Village,Historic Walking Areas,4.5,"A great half day trip, provided the weather is good.","Where do I begin?I cast my mind back some 70 years or so, ( I'm now 76 ). As a young lad, growing up in Willesden NW London, my mother would sometimes quote the first few lines of a poem, ' There is a one eyed yellow Idol, to the north of Kathmandu '. To me, then, the name Kathmandu, had a magical sound to it, and it still does. Having first come to this magical city in 1997/8, and several times since, it's only this last couple of months that I be learnt that the poem, (written in 1911),  is actually based on a real idol, still worshipped by the local people, in the temple way above the village of Sankhu. Having read this, I thought that I would like to visit it for myself. Having eventually found the correct bus, with the help of a kindly Nepalese man, amongst the many busses around Ratna Park, I boarded, and it soon departed on the 2 hour bumpy and dusty journey, through mainly built up area. It's about 20 kilometres northeast of Kathmandu, and is a typical busy village.After a lunch of veg momos, I set off for the temple, due north of the bus park.After about a kilometre of fairly easy going, I was directed to a path which dipped between broadleaved trees, then started ascending. After crossing a metalled road the stairs began. All 600 or so. I counted them on the way back.The temple is not visible until you are almost up to it, being surrounded by many trees, with plenty of small monkeys to keep you company.Upon my arrival, there were a couple of ladies sweeping the grounds, a security guard and a Buddhist priest there. The temple is used by both Buddhist and Hindu worshippers.The priest kindly unlocked golden doors so that I could view the Goddess, and to her right, a smaller Hanuman idol.Noon is allowed in or allowed to take photos of them.Both idols were dressed in red garments, full length.I was allowed to take photos of the outside of the temple, tho.So, from my mother's quotes, seventy years ago, I was at the actual place mentioned in poem.Much to my great satisfaction "
291,Sankhu Village,Historic Walking Areas,4.5,Sankhu - oldest town in Kathmandu valley,Bhaktapur is nice and a world heritage. But Sankhu looks like Bhaktapur did 20 years ago and shows how a small Nepali Newari town looked hundreds of years ago.
292,Sankhu Village,Historic Walking Areas,4.5,One of the oldest newar valley,"the most amazing place.just 1-2 hours far from kathmandu . here are many temples ,people here are so friendly ,many historical temple lies here.like bajrayogene salinadi."
293,Sankhu Village,Historic Walking Areas,4.5,Very old town in Kathmandu,It was very old town in kathmandu and there is Milarepa cave and Bajrayogini temple which is Buddhist and hindus focal point religiously
294,Sankhu Village,Historic Walking Areas,4.5,It's Worth it to Go .....,It is a wonderful place peopled by rugged long suffering human beings . It has such a quality to it Sankhu Village - you can feel the sadness rising out of the rubble from that dirty rotten earthquake . Why didn't it happen somewhere completely different . Fate is fickle . SO if you are in Town go and leave some of your money there they need it BUT they also need your compassion and your smiles ....
295,Sankhu Village,Historic Walking Areas,4.5,Old city village,"The city had temples, water fountains, stone roads, but now much of it is in rubble, after the earthquake. Still a good place to visit."
296,Sankhu Village,Historic Walking Areas,4.5,TRADITIONAL PLACE,"this is a good place for cluture lover,people are awesome they treat guest like god.and they served food with is amazing"
297,Sankhu Village,Historic Walking Areas,4.5,Must visit,"If it's only to spend some money in local shops, coz this historic settlement was severly damaged by the earthquakes. The Vajrayogini temple is still standing, but squares and houses were devastated...people are so resilient, trying to survive and make something of their lives. Even 2 years after the quakes almost nothing has been done here. There is still a group of people who get hardly any food. Locals will help eachother, but it's almost unbearable for the community. Government and most (or all?) NGO's have left."
298,Sankhu Village,Historic Walking Areas,4.5,Rebuilding Sankhu Village,"I have visited Sanku village on many occasions. May 2015 saw a very different place to the village in Feb 2015 due the the earthquake. Passing through in May shocked me to say the least, the utter devastation of the whole town and the silence that was in the air. I have just returned from the region and saw at first hand how resilient and proud the Nepalese people are. Yes, more buildings require demolition but shops have reopened and people have returned yet a very long way to go before it is what it used to be."
299,Sankhu Village,Historic Walking Areas,4.5,'open museum',"This village town can be reached by a car or bus or motorbike with an hour and a half from the kathmandu City. You will find the old city village with beautiful temples, squares, water fountains. In the periphery of the town are many antique statues scattered as the temples crumbled down long ago. This area needs lots of help for donors and government agencies. With the devastating earthquake nearly half the village town is damaged. Must visit destination"
300,Amideva Buddha Park,Park,4,park with statue,located next to swambhu or monkey temple in the foothill near the road. Buddhist park they say and quite a small one. have few big statues and not very clean place.
301,Amideva Buddha Park,Park,4,Should not be missed when you visit the Swayambhunath Temple,"Not many tourists will come to this temple, so you can enjoy the quietness and peacefulness of the environment.The Buddha statues were beautiful, I feel that this should not be missed especially for those who visit the Swayambhunath as it is just a short walk from there."
302,Amideva Buddha Park,Park,4,Big buddhas,"If you visit the Swayambhunath temple, don't forget to bring a visit to this little park. Very nice and impressive to see the 3 large golden buddhas. Unforunately when I visited in March 2019 there were some scaffolding around the buddhas."
303,Amideva Buddha Park,Park,4,Incredible,"This park is incredible. The sheer size of the statues are unbelievable. It doesnt take very long to walk around, but you will love going for a visit! There tend to be monkeys around as its close to the monkey temple, so you might see them too!"
304,Amideva Buddha Park,Park,4,Nice for a few mins,Close to the Swayambhunath temple. Good to combine visits. Buddha park stroll takes around 10 mins. Nice if you have some time!
305,Amideva Buddha Park,Park,4,Wow!,An attraction seamingly missed by most tourists and only 10mins away from Monkey Temple which is heaving! Amazing Bhudda statues and other features plus views across the city and vallryMust do!
306,Amideva Buddha Park,Park,4,Amazing jewel missed by the tourists,"It is surprising to me that one place like this is normally not visited by tourists. This is by far much more beautiful than the famous Monkey Temple, and just 10 min away walking. Built in the 2000s, it is still clean and tidy. Free entrance and as said above, only local people."
307,Amideva Buddha Park,Park,4,Beautiful,"This park is at the foot of the hill along the parikrama (circumambulation of Swayambunath) route. It's definitely worth a visit. Three huge golden Buddhas are the main feature of the park, though there is also a large, beautiful stupa and lovely gardens. I'm not sure if it's actually part of the park, but around one side you can see an enormous prayer wheel. It's a popular park, yet still peaceful enough to sit and meditate. There was no entrance fee and I was not asked for any donation when I went in."
308,Amideva Buddha Park,Park,4,Attention at the entrance,"Have been told that it was free entrance but as soon as we put the feet on the entrance step a man jumped on us asking for entrance fee. He could not speak proper English, he said ""500 rupies entrance"". He prepared a printed receipt (all in Nepali) from a little table and gave to us after taken the big ammount. I was upset and didn't look properly. The park was nice and quiet, far from the busy dusty Kathmandu. The visit was quick and full of religious atmosphere as per my experience.When I found someone who could speak English, I explained the situation of the entrance and showed the paper. It was actually an offer for the rebuilding of a monastery somewhere outside the city. Offers should not be imposed! and NOT been asked in that fraudulent way to tourists who don't speak local language. I felt mestreated, when I had such a good experience with Nepali people until that moment. I just hope that the money will really go to that cause, in order to help a monastery and it will be good for Karma of all sentient beings. Namaste!"
309,Amideva Buddha Park,Park,4,Worth Adding to Monkey Temple Visit,"More beautiful and more peaceful than Monkey Temple, tourists are well advised to journey to the opposite side of the hill to spend time in Buddha Park.  Highlighted by three large statues honoring Nepali cultural aspects of Buddhism, the park offers a haven from the chaos of Kathmandu--far less hectic than the area immediately surrounding the main entrance to the Monkey Temple.There are numerous stupas in the area, along with large prayer wheels, candle offerings, and local items for sale. At the very least, it is a beautiful site for photo ops.... and you can see plenty of monkeys in the area if you wish. I visit Nepal 2 - 3 times during the year and have made pilgrimages here each time.  In fact, it's more satisfying than visiting the top of the more popular Monkey Temple on the opposite side of the hill."
310,Kala Bhairav,"Religious Sites,Monuments and Statues",4.5,powerful and beautiful,this statue looked very powerful and a bit scary in some ways and the religious significance made this statue even more amazing. it was really cool to see the locals worshipping the statue.
311,Kala Bhairav,"Religious Sites,Monuments and Statues",4.5,Religious,Kaal Bhairab is believed to have been sculptured from a single stone. Its a religious statue and people worship it for courage and happiness.

320,Vajrayogini Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,"Vajrayogini Temple - not to miss, just outside Kathmandu","Old temple of Vajrayogini, to travel through narrow village roads and wheat fields, up the hill. Went in Toyota Hiace, but a 4 wheel drive vehicle would be better. To walk by foot some 500 steps to reach temple. The main temple is intact, adjacent structures damaged during the earthquake are being rebuilt."
321,Vajrayogini Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,So beautiful and majestic!,"I'm running out of adjectives to describe the temples in Kathmandu.   Each is unique unto itself,  but together they add to the magic of this ancient city."
322,Vajrayogini Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,"It s a trip to the east of the valley, but absolute one of my favorite","The place is a bit forgotten since the earthquake hit the temple not much has been repaired. You have to drive behind Sankhu and climb up the stairs to the Temple. The view is really nice and it is not the place where tourists usually go, so you will find still a traditional holy place with peaceful surrounding"
323,Vajrayogini Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Superb,"Incredible place for intellectual exploration, deep meditation, or just enjoying the view. The cave is especially interesting... you'll see what I mean, especially if you just went to Yonglesho..."
324,Vajrayogini Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Very nice,"Though its bit difficult to reach this temple, its worth visiting. Need to climb quite a few stairs to reach to the top"
325,Vajrayogini Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,No words to say,"Normal visitors can not imagine that there is a temple like this is situated on the hill tops.  The hardcore tourists only can explore such temples. It is a very very beautiful temple even mostof the local drivers/ people also do not know about this temple. Don't Miss it, My special suggest to the readers."
326,Vajrayogini Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,when there to pray,good but took a lot of effort and is it very high up  with a lot of stairs to climb but worth the effort a good historic place
327,Vajrayogini Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Single stone statue,This holy statue is situated in Kathmandu Darbar square and it was carved on single stone. According to carving date it was done in 7th centure
328,Vajrayogini Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Old Kathmandu valley at its best.,Mixed buddhist and Hindu tempel ont the old Tibet road.  Old history now getting encroached by the ever expanding Kathmandu metropolis.  Still a most but not much visited place.  Easy access with taxi or bycicle.
329,Vajrayogini Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,A very special place,"This temple (again a bit of a task to get to, due to the rough roads) is well worth the time! It is secluded, and I would say under developed in a commercial sense. The spiritual feeling one receives during the visit is very comforting! Please consider making the trip to this sacred place"
330,Astrek Climbing Wall,Sports Complexes,4.5,Very professional staff. An activity for all ages and levels,"Came with my 6 year-old. The staff was extremely nice, pedagogical and patient with her. She managed to climb a bit and really enjoyed it. Other than that the location is central and hopping. Lots of mountaineers, guides and Nepali athletes come to train there. The ambiance is fun and makes you want to come back!"
331,Astrek Climbing Wall,Sports Complexes,4.5,First Time Experience,"A great place to visit if you are looking some for indoor adventure. Friendly people and staff. Had a lot of fun playing, climbing and jumping around with friends.  Good and healthy choice to spend a day at Kathmandu. Travelers might get chances to engage with other travelers and might even have chances to meetup with professional rock climbers who often pay visit for practice sessions."
332,Astrek Climbing Wall,Sports Complexes,4.5,A place for chilling,"As its the oldest and first ever climbing wall its superb for all the people. The staffs are friendly,the price is less, the place is quiet. It has extended more walls so i would prefer this climbing wall for enjoying the time. If you are into sports or you like some adventure then you can go in this climbing wall. Its perfect to go with your friends,family or your kids as well. You will have a great experience there. You will also find the restaurants with different cuisine."
333,Astrek Climbing Wall,Sports Complexes,4.5,Great fun; great staff!,Family climbed for an hour or two.  Nice to have courtyard with good food to relax and watch each other.  The guy who helped us were attentive and kind.  Great place for family fun in KTM.
334,Astrek Climbing Wall,Sports Complexes,4.5,Spiderman for a day,"Climbed there twice, enjoyed it both times. The staffs were super friendly and guided us throughout the process. Once you reach the top, you will want to do it again. 50 feet wall looks intimidating but once you reach the top, I can't describe how good you feel about yourself. The experience is even more fun while getting down. You almost feel like a superhero."
335,Astrek Climbing Wall,Sports Complexes,4.5,Great community vibes,"We had a great time bouldering and hanging out with the locals, who shared beta and joined us in working some interesting problems. The food was delicious and the general vibe was very nice due to the friendly staff!"
336,Astrek Climbing Wall,Sports Complexes,4.5,Fantastic staff and facilities,"After a little help from google maps, we found this haven at the edge of Thamel. Because it was only early (10 am), we got the whole place to ourselves. The belay was only 100 NRS for 5 turns and the helpful staff told me where to put my feet as well as challenging me to choose only one colour of rocks. After the belay, we could use the bouldering wall which was included in our price. Again, the staff gave us tips on how to improve our performance. Overall a great experience for beginners to advanced climbers."
337,Astrek Climbing Wall,Sports Complexes,4.5,Surprise have in Thamel,"While looking for things to do with the kids in Thamel after our trek we came across Astrek online. After a little searching around the narrow roads we found it and what a great surprise, it is tucked away in a quiet courtyard outside the Belgian consulate. There are 2 great bouldering walls and the huge 15 metre climbing wall with 5 climbs of varying difficulty. All the equipment can be hired and for a tiny fee the guys will belay for you. On our first visit the kids spent hours climbing and the cost was well below $10 AUD. There us a cafe onsite and the prices are unbelievably cheap with sandwiches from RS150, coke RS45   and tea RS20.I would highly recommend to anyone fit enough and particularly teenagers."
338,Astrek Climbing Wall,Sports Complexes,4.5,A welcoming community of climbers,"Astrek is the place to climb if you're looking for something exciting to do in Kathmandu. It's an awesome place to get active, meet new people or even sit and chat and watch other climbers climb. Astrek is a very welcoming place to be in and the staff is friendly, knowledgeable and safe. The location is right at the heart of Thamel and prices are extremely affordable. You can also rent gear from climbing shoes, to harnesses and chalk bags. There is a climbing wall and 2 bouldering walls - challenging enough for all levels.The people there are really approachable, they will welcome you into their community.I participated in their ""Monsoon Madness"" Lead Climbing Competition in June 2016 and I can say that having never competed in the past, the experience was one I would never forget. The energy of the people they brought together, the well-organized team at Astrek, as well as the talented climbers made the experience unforgettable. This competition allowed me to meet amazing people and become a part of the climbing community in Kathmandu. I can say that Astrek played a big part in making my 3-month experience in Nepal memorable.I would suggest for anyone from beginners to advanced-level climbers to check out Astrek if you're looking to make new friends, train hard, or try it for the first time. You might even fall in love with the sport of climbing!"
339,Astrek Climbing Wall,Sports Complexes,4.5,More than just a climbing wall,"Astrek is a great place to climb, hang out or just have a drink. The atmosphere is very relaxed and the staff are super friendly. There are plenty of routes for all levels. The food is good too!"
340,Templo de Changu Narayan,Points of Interest and Landmarks,4.5,an another temple,Another Hindu temple although similar to others around Kathmandu. less crowded than the city yet not clean and dirty. a bit far from KTM and u find many dogs and animals around. few shops are located. few trekking routes are connected with this place. view os good.
341,Templo de Changu Narayan,Points of Interest and Landmarks,4.5,Worth seeing if youre on the Nagarkot trek,"An interesting Hindu temple although similar to others around Kathmandu area. This place is less crowded than the ones in the main city, but more dirty. There were quite a few diseased dogs and monkeys, lots of construction work, smoke and rubbish lying around. As is customary, the lead up to the temple is dotted with shops and people peddling much of the same stuff you can get everywhere."
342,Templo de Changu Narayan,Points of Interest and Landmarks,4.5,a sip of the old times,"Located on a hill nearby the busy city centre, this temple sits on the very top. The village surrounding has a lot of flavour but is shows that it's been rebuilt after the 2015 earthquake. Full of smalls shops selling crafts, the temple is majestic even amidst all the rubble. Revered by the locals, it's a nice way to spend an afternoon."
343,Templo de Changu Narayan,Points of Interest and Landmarks,4.5,Must see,"It is situated some 20 km from Kathmandu, but it takes like one hour drive to get there. But its worth it. One of my favourite places during my stay in Nepal.Beautiful temple with stone and wood carvings. The temple is on top a hill. From the entrance you climb the steps through the village passing artisan studios and shops. According to legends Changu Narayan temple existed as early as 325 a.d.   Read a legend about Changu Narayan before you go. A real hidden gem."
344,Templo de Changu Narayan,Points of Interest and Landmarks,4.5,Bakthapur,If you happen to visit bakthapur then you must definitely try the bakthapur yogurt or dhahi.Shopping in bhaktapur is extremely cheap you can always bargain with vendors.
345,Templo de Changu Narayan,Points of Interest and Landmarks,4.5,Changu Narayan - Oldest Temple in Nepal,"This Architecture is a must see ,  the entire design of the temple with its courtyard shows the level of Architectural skills people had while following the ancient hindu religion.  This is a must visit temple for the grandeur itself."
346,Templo de Changu Narayan,Points of Interest and Landmarks,4.5,Heritage Site - 2000 + years old - Best in Nepal,"Vishnu Temple around 25kms outside Kathmandu, near Bakthapur. Granite & wood carvings with paintings all around. On a hill, to walk 200mtrs from the parking area, both sides of the road that leads to the temple have handicraft work of wood carvings, wall hangings, handwoven caps/hats, cotton-canvas paintings of Buddhists & Hindu gods/rituals/ways of life & painting classes. Few tourists taken there, do not miss. If you find a good priest, he will share lots of stories about the temple's history  & generally about Hindu & Buddhist Tantric practices. He also recommends many more such sites in Nepal"
347,Templo de Changu Narayan,Points of Interest and Landmarks,4.5,Impressive temple on top of a hill,"Changunarayan is said to be one of the oldest temples in The Valley. One can reach the temple following the uphill path from the ticket office. There are shops and houses along the way and the whole walk is pleasant and relaxed. There are people selling things but they are not pushy. The temple itself is really ornate and beautiful and it is well used. There are offerings everywhere and statues with flower garlands, etc. One can walk around the courtyard and the sides of this little gem, but not inside the inner sanctum. Worth visiting for sure!"
348,Templo de Changu Narayan,Points of Interest and Landmarks,4.5,Oldest Hindu Temple of the valley,"Surrounded by pine trees, the whole hill has a magical energy. Badly destroyed by the earthquake the community has made a big effort to rebuilt and to safe the temple which was damaged but not destroyed. Terrific place for picnic and walks, best to reach from Bhaktapur by road or you walk from Thali up the hill."
349,Templo de Changu Narayan,Points of Interest and Landmarks,4.5,Beautiful Hindu Temple,This temple is very old so the appreciation of the crafts used to build it is very high.  We were there when a group of Hindu worshippers were praying and it made our experience very memourable.
350,White Monastery,Points of Interest and Landmarks,4,Attempting Visit.,"Dont waste your time visiting... absolutely no Public Relations Officer present. Typical Nepal run around. Youd think they might have a Repesentative to talk to visitors... but its Nepal... Nothing works, everything is backwards. And everything is corrupt. This is just another example of why this country is Failing."
351,White Monastery,Points of Interest and Landmarks,4,Gorgeous place for day tour in Kathmandu,"Well, it was a tour a while ago but really like to write something about this gorgeous place. This unique and fascinating architectural monastery is a really unmissable place when anyone is in Kathmandu. Many tourists in kathmandu have been looking for something that gives even for a short time peace and happiness that could be the white monastery. But the one a bit important thing in my opinion if the monastery would have  a way to let everyone about the monastery and its open day for visitor that would be a convenient help to the tourist because White Monastery doesn't open everyday of the week so many of them don't know about this and sometime the  visitors travel to the Monastery but it is just a waist cant get in and visit of the place. And if someone you don't know what day this monastery is open for the visitors then now you know it open only Sunday for everyone. White Monastery's location is just perfect. The high hill is another best spot for looking a beautiful greenery kathmandu valley. Best recommend to everyone to visit this monastery in kathmandu. The Buddhism is wonderful philosophy to know and the things you know from the visit of  white monastery could be something great knowledge for you."
352,White Monastery,Points of Interest and Landmarks,4,Once visit,This Monastery  shows buddhist culture as well as  their traditional whereabouts. One will have to find out before going whether it is opened or not.
353,White Monastery,Points of Interest and Landmarks,4,Cool,"Cool, calm, beautiful and quiet. Perfect place for meditation. If you want to be out of hectic throng nearby, this is the right place to be fresh."
354,White Monastery,Points of Interest and Landmarks,4,Not great,This Buddhist monastery is provides preaching on Buddhist literature. However this place remains mostly closed
355,White Monastery,Points of Interest and Landmarks,4,"May 2018, Still Closed !!!","I didn't find any recent information about the gumba, whether it was open or still shut. So, went on a hike to find out myself. It's sad to learn that the construction is still in progress, few new buildings and renovations, the main entrance gate is being built from the ground, so it is likely to be closed for a long time."
356,White Monastery,Points of Interest and Landmarks,4,Not Worth the Stop,"The monks were chanting while we were there, but we couldn't see anything, so that was interesting to hear. But other than that, the monastery isn't much to look at so unless you have nothing else to do, I wouldn't bother."
357,White Monastery,Points of Interest and Landmarks,4,attended buddhist teachings,Buddhist teachings and classes. as a tourist not really anything to do there. Attended Buddhist teachings with Chokyi Niyma Rinpoche who was there for 2 weeks of annual winter teachings. wonderful.
358,White Monastery,Points of Interest and Landmarks,4,it is little heaven on earth,Be sure if you are hiring Taxi from Swayambu to white monastery then pay NRP 300/. only. otherwse Taxi wala may ask for more than Rs600//
359,White Monastery,Points of Interest and Landmarks,4,Amazing view from the top,"The walk is quite uphill, so need comfortable clothes and shoes. The monastery is painted white completely."
360,Taudaha Lake,Bodies of Water,4,good for looking ducks,Taudaha is a good place to see migrating ducks in winter in Kathmandu valley. the development is ruining the real natural habitat of migrating birds
361,Taudaha Lake,Bodies of Water,4,Good experience indeed.,One of the best places to visit at the outskirt of Kathmandu valley. Good memories.Safe parking (for 2 wheelers). Clean water/Lake management should be considered in order to add more beauties to the site.Overall good experience indeed.
362,Taudaha Lake,Bodies of Water,4,fish feeding and greenery,"The place is very amazing, peaceful and the lake has a great number of fishes and we were allowed to do fish feeding. I went there with my friends for my weekends and the place has a beautiful photogenic view. It is 1hr away from the ratnapark bus park and the entrance fee was about Rs.20 for students."
363,Taudaha Lake,Bodies of Water,4,Nearest place from Kathmandu Valley to see migratory birds,"If you're a bird lover, then head for this small lake on the way to Dakshinkali Temple to the south of Kathmandu Valley. I get there every December - January to see the birds flying from as far as Siberia. The most common are cormorants and coots which can be found throughout the year here."
364,Taudaha Lake,Bodies of Water,4,one of the best venure,"there you can enjoy the place, the place is really close to the capital on the way to dakshinkali and it will be one of the best way to be enjoyed. i feel great to be there feeding fish and have few restaurants along and give the best food to us."
365,Taudaha Lake,Bodies of Water,4,Amazing lake with great number of fishes,"The place is very mesmerizing and near to the capital. We can spend your valuable time on a cheap entrance price. Also, we can feed fishes or leave our fish there."
366,Taudaha Lake,Bodies of Water,4,Good place to chill and feed the fish.,I had an amazing time and lots of fun during my visit to Taudaha lake. I went there with my Nepali friends and we took the 10kgs of food for the fish. This place had many cafes and locals who sells fish food and other stuffs as well.
367,Taudaha Lake,Bodies of Water,4,You have to see it to believe it,I only had a few days left in Kathmandu and I was lucky enough to have a local show me this very interesting fish infested pond. He said there was a lot of fish but there is way more... Its really nice to buy a bag of fish feed and walk around the lake to get photos and try to guess just how many fish are in there. If you are up to trying 'street food' there is a lady who serves pani puri and it is to die for! I would travel back just to have it! Its vegetarian too!
368,Taudaha Lake,Bodies of Water,4,Lake with a cultural story,The lake is a favorite for winter migratory birds. It is a tranquil and undisturbed waterbody that houses a variety of fresh water fishes and snakes.
369,Taudaha Lake,Bodies of Water,4,Holy lake and Bird watching sport Taudaha,Taudaha is the historical lake about the Karkat Nag Snake god. This place is not only holy place it also best winter Migrating wetland bird watching place.
370,Shechen Monastery,Religious Sites,4.5,Peaceful places with lots of things to see,"Must go place for spiritual connection, Oldest live arts, to learn paintings, and the free school is really interesting."
371,Shechen Monastery,Religious Sites,4.5,To Attend  Special Transmission,"There were 10000 monks and laypeople from all over the world attending. It was 7 days a week for about 4 weeks . Mathieu Ricard  , Dzongsar Khentse Rinpoche  , Yangtse Dilgo Khentse  etc"
372,Shechen Monastery,Religious Sites,4.5,A slice of Heaven,I was blessed to participate in a empowerment held here. The monks were chanting and it seemed that I was in another dimension one of light. They also have an amazing vegetarian cafe. The food is clean and exquisite. They also have stupas and prayer wheels you can spin. This is one of my favorite places.
373,Shechen Monastery,Religious Sites,4.5,Beauty behind the building construction at Shechen,"Shechen Monastery is one of the biggest and oldest monasteries in the Boudha area and well worth a visit. However do not be put off by the large amount of building construction going on at the entrance - it is all part of repairs and rebuilding after the big 2015 earthquakes. Take your time to walk around the temple and look for the eight stupas to the left of the main temple and find your way to the Shechen Guest House vegetarian caf for a meal or a snack. It has the most beautiful garden. And looks for hidden surprises which can be found here and there with ceremonies, repainting the main temple building and other events. Today the monks put flowers and holy water around the eight stupas next to the Shedra which is the College of Buddhist Philosophy and it was a sight to behold. Shechen Monastery at Boudha held ceremonies in memory of Jamgn Ju Mipham, or Mipham Jamyang Namgyal Gyamtso (18461912) - also known as 'Mipham the Great'.  Photos show the beautiful flower arrangements around stupas inside Shechen monastery this morning - one the many surprises you can find as you walk around the Shechen grounds. Well worth a visit despite the building construction at the entrance."
374,Shechen Monastery,Religious Sites,4.5,Peaceful in the midst of bustle,"This monastery is just a 5-min walk away from Boudhanath Stupa. We wanted to visit a monastery on our trip to Nepal and visiting Boudhanath was a prefect opportunity to do so because there are tons of monasteries around. Shechen monastery caught our eye while searching online for monasteries we could visit, and we decided to do so after we were done with Boudhanath. There's a lovely temple in the Shechen monastery where we sat and meditated for 30 minutes or so. The monks there offered us a mat to sit on while we meditated, and as they gathered to have tea before starting their prayers, they offered us tea as well. We got to witness the amazing peace and quiet in the midst of the bustle of Boudhanath and it's an experience I won't forget!"
375,Shechen Monastery,Religious Sites,4.5,Large Buddhist Monastery To The West Of The Stupa,This large monastery sits to the west of the stupa and down an alley.  This was established to replace a similar monastery in Tibet that was destroyed and now has over 300 monks in residence. We were not able to enter but apparently it has interesting murals. It was damaged in 2015.
376,Shechen Monastery,Religious Sites,4.5,"Excellent monastery, but currently construction is going on","I went there looking for the guest house and cafe, but the cafe is closed for construction, and it seems like the guest house might be, too. The temple is also getting some renovation. Apart from that, it's a wonderful, peaceful place to walk around. The temple is not as ornate as some others, but it has a really good feeling. You can go in and walk around in spite of all the construction going on. It's only a short walk from Boudanath Stupa."
377,The National Museum,"Art Museums, History Museums",3.5,Dim experience,"The museums except the first one you enter have no lights. The neighborhood itself has little to no electricity, which makes it extremely hard to view the museum pieces. We were not told this before entering otherwise we would have brought a flashlight. They also charge for every phone you bring in to take pictures? If we had known about the light issue we would have paid to bring in more phones to use the built in flashlight. Maybe they need to charge a bit more for entrance and install some solar panels to run a minimum of lights?"
378,The National Museum,"Art Museums, History Museums",3.5,2000 Years of Nepal Culture,"Internationally Nepal art and culture doesn't receive much coverage in museums-- far more exhibits for India, China, Japan, Thailand. But Nepal has  rich historical treasures on display here. Not often visited by foreigners, it offers a great deal of Nepalese art and culture at an extremely affordable price: 150 rupees (about $1.50 US)."
379,The National Museum,"Art Museums, History Museums",3.5,some beautiful ancient buddhist sculptures in a sleepy old palace,"This museum has some beautiful buddhist art pieces and interesting informative labelling in the buddhist galleries.  A great place to find out more about the various statues and dieties you see in temples in Nepal. The museum is only a short walk from swayambhu stupa (the monkey temple) and is rarely visited and rather sleepy. The ethnographic section on different cultural groups of Nepal is interesting but rather dusty and tired- could do with a refresh and expansion. There is a collection of dolls in cultural dress from around the world. There is also a building housing a coin collaction, which places the evolution of Nepali coins in historical context and takes you on a journey through Nepali history, but is probably only for for serious coin aficianados. The old building itself is intersting to see. The museum would benefit from a good cafe, a gift shop and some signposts from swayambhu- then could be really great place for tourists to learn more about religion and culture of Nepal."
380,The National Museum,"Art Museums, History Museums",3.5,average,an average museum. located in the city. not many things to see. better to go to mountains than wasting time here. very ordinary
381,The National Museum,"Art Museums, History Museums",3.5,Old Museum,"The Museum is in the city centre as is a time capsule of the past. Very interesting and worth a visit. When you arrive you cannot take and phones, cameras, bags or anything like that inside and you have to leave them in a locker and you have the key. Loads of armed guards! We sat down on a seat in the garden and were immediately whistled at by a guard and told to get up. No resting anywhere. Quite a few stairs and narrow passages. Lots of pictures of famous visitors including our Royal Family."
382,The National Museum,"Art Museums, History Museums",3.5,Not very special,"Nice to visit if you are nearby and have some time left, but not a very large and interesting museum. The collection is more of a kind gathered stuff that has hardly any connection. Everything from old sculptures, coins, stuffed animals, smile mirrors till worldwide dolls."
383,The National Museum,"Art Museums, History Museums",3.5,Not up to a National museum standard,"Its about $1.50 to enter and thats a reasonable price for what you get...Its totally run down - 6 people manning each door gas bagging - their time would be better spent maintaining the place - its dusty, overgrown and really dirty! Would not recommend. 90% of displays are from the 19th & 20th century - hardly exciting antiques.Not convenient to get to either.Also just for more info - 2 of 3 buildings are statues of Buddha which became boring and repetitive. The other building has some amateur taxidermy and a few interesting animal skulls. This building is the only one worth a look in."
384,The National Museum,"Art Museums, History Museums",3.5,Great interesting museum,"Very informative museum with 3 separate buildings - historical statues, Buddhist religion and Nepal culture.  Enjoyable"
385,The National Museum,"Art Museums, History Museums",3.5,First Museum in Nepal needing attention to keep up !,First Museum in Nepal needing attention to keep up ! Different things kept in one place.  Could have expanded much more ! Located in west part of Kathmandu.
386,The National Museum,"Art Museums, History Museums",3.5,very good historical collection before united nepal,this is very nearby swambhu nath temple one of the world heritage site in nepal. public transport is good .
387,Nagarjun Forest Reserve,"Nature and Wildlide Areas, Forests",4,waste oif time,"I went there early one morning. It is supposed to open at 7am, but the staff are too lazy to get to work on time. Unfreiendly army guards. The forest road are dark and we saw little bird life."
388,Nagarjun Forest Reserve,"Nature and Wildlide Areas, Forests",4,Poor,"First I'm talking about the hill which is classified national park since 2009 the small hill close to Kathmandu.You need to have a guide, its impossible to go by your own.The ""national park"" is surrounded by fences and army guards. The guide doesnt speak really good English it was really hard to understand him. He didn't talk actually. It's a hike of 3h, and 2h steep up, where normally you can see animals but of course we saw nothing, I think its really to take money from tourists people. It was around 1900np per person.Be smart : keep your money and do something else"
389,Nagarjun Forest Reserve,"Nature and Wildlide Areas, Forests",4,Prepare before you go,"Nice place to go if you want to escape the city and go for a walk in nature. But be aware this is milatary area! You have to show your passport at the entrance, write down your contact details and leave behind one passport. My advise is to bring good copies, and with us they accepted these and kept a copy. Normally you have to rent a guide, but in our case there was no guide available so we only had to pay the entrance fee. Many roads are made with stairs, so you have to climb a lot of stairs. On your way you might pass some military check points where you have to report before you pass by. Enjoy the views on top of the mountain over Kathmandu. Bring enough water, there are no shops on the mountain."
390,Nagarjun Forest Reserve,"Nature and Wildlide Areas, Forests",4,Day Hiking Nagarjung Hill from City.,"I have visited the Nagarjung Hill entering from Budhanilkantha, and reached at Nagarjun hill after 3 hours walking to climbing up hill and seen fantastic Jungle views and Mountains."
391,Nagarjun Forest Reserve,"Nature and Wildlide Areas, Forests",4,Himalayan Countryside Outside Kathmandu,"Booked a driver and car(4x4) for the afternoon from my hotel,Kathmandu Boutique,to take me up to the Countryside outside Kathmandu for a bit of scenery and fresher air. taking the Trisuli road,well if you can call it a road ,you need at least a 4x4 to get along here,there is very little tarmac,steepsides lots of traffic buses/lorries that believe me iam amazed how they actually get along it in some parts.Anyway up and a turn off to the forrest area which has some good little treks,there are are also a few hills to climb up around here and one with a lookout tower which overlooks the valley and back towards Kathmandu,it was damaged during the earth quake ,and they are rebuilding it,you can go up,but i would advise to wait until its finished, there is another hill quite a lot of steps up to a stupa/temple.Further along the road we bounced, passing some very tight road passes,stopping at a large restaurant/hotel complex with great views over the valley and beyond,the road/track carries on up and through the valley,unbelievable this road its got to be impassible during the rainy/winter season,passing small villages,road sellers and occasional houses/shacks hanging off the road/cliff edge.We reached Kakani and a small village with a military school ,but also some good views of the himalayers,again you can walk around here for views and various parks/stupas monuments. the whole trip cost me $50 for about 6hrs there and back ,so i got to see at least some of the countryside some scenic views with a few treks thrown in, the weather was very humid and being up over 2500 ft some of the views where very hazy in the valley,i enjoyed the day ,but alas still have that road to travel back on , Tip if you want to go along the Trisuli road by local bus because its cheaper ( if you must ) get a seat ,do not stand .You will be bounced all over."
392,Nagarjun Forest Reserve,"Nature and Wildlide Areas, Forests",4,No need to book an expensive tour.,"Using my pre-loaded satellite map, I walked to Nagarjun entrance from Lazimpat and then hired a guide (compulsory) at the park gate total 1300 rupees. Return taxi to Lazimpat cost $500 rupees. The hike to the Stupa was very steep. You need to be fit to enjoy. Try and go on a clear day for maximum views over Kathmandu and Valley. Total travelling time return to Lazimpat 6 hours. Amazing journey on foot through suburbs along the way. Take lots of water!!"
393,Nagarjun Forest Reserve,"Nature and Wildlide Areas, Forests",4,Mountain view,This place offers very nice Himalayan views. Not very much crowded makes this place very attractive.
394,Nagarjun Forest Reserve,"Nature and Wildlide Areas, Forests",4,A nice hill walk just outside Kathmandu,"You like to be in nature outside of the city?The  Nagarjun Forrest Reserve may be an option. It's basically a walk over many concrete stairs and sandy paths up to the monastry on top of the hill. It takes about 2 hours to climb up, depending on your fitness and the night before perhaps. It's a nice activity! The down side is the entree price of RS 565 for foreigners and the compulsory 'guide'. After having being there several times, the compulsory guide turned me off that I decided not to go in. A sad and another wrong decision of the government concerning tourism. The excuse that the area may not be good to visit all alone, is simply not enough. A nice activity, but due to the compulsory guide, I rate it Poor..."
395,Nagarjun Forest Reserve,"Nature and Wildlide Areas, Forests",4,Tourist Scam!!,"As I have discovered, as with most things in Nepal for tourists this is a bit of a scam. We reached the forest entrance from Thamel (pay no more than 500 Rupees for a taxi), to find that as a foreigner it cost 565 Rupees per person to enter. This wouldn't be too bad if it wasn't also for the fact that it is compulsory as a non-Nepalese to have a ""guide"". The compulsory ""guide"" costs 800 Rupees for 3 hours. Apparently you must have a guide because you could get lost of hurt, this is rubbish as we discovered. The 3 hours consisted of walking up some steps and an easily followed path for a few hours through pretty life devoid, unimpressive forest. After a couple of hours you reach the top where the view of the mountains is pretty good. At this point the ""guide"" (who has been following behind saying nothing, all pretty awkward) says we should head back down as 3 hours will soon be up. So in total for the excursion we paid nearly 30 dollars worth for a weird and uninspiring day."
396,Nagarjun Forest Reserve,"Nature and Wildlide Areas, Forests",4,Could be amazing,"Great views of the valley but badly maintained roads so must have a 4w jeep or motorcross bike. Strange its not better maintained.As u Walk along the road, path ways and such could just wish for better maintenance, rest rooms and fresh drinking water. Afterall they charge a fee for entering. Monssteries, temples and a few buildings are scaresly spread out! Take what u need before u enter as nothing to buy once inside."
397,Degu Taleju Temple,Religious Sites,4,Must see on Durbar Square tour,Another beautiful old temple to see on the tour in this old town World Heritage site. Stop and take pictures and imagine the lifestyles of these nobles/royals who worshiped here in their day!
398,Degu Taleju Temple,Religious Sites,4,Taleju Temple Durbar Square,The official guide from the Hanuman-Dhoka Durbar Conservation Program lists Dega Taleju Temple (ref 29) as a separate much smaller structure to the main Taleju Temple (ref 38) to which previous reviews seem to refer. The latter was built in 1564 by King Mahendra Malla  and is the tallest structure in the square. It apparently an 'ultra-sacrosanct' temple which is opened to the public only once a year during Dashain.
399,Degu Taleju Temple,Religious Sites,4,Degu Taleju Tempel,Its worth it to visit this temple. You see the Hindus praying and giving flowers to the statues. Just sit down and get this special feeling
400,Degu Taleju Temple,Religious Sites,4,Not Open To The Public,This is a significant temple in the Durbah Square but is not open to the public and even for Hindu's it is apparently restricted. It is behind the Seto Bhairab on the north eastern side of the square and you can see the temple from behind the walls. The 35 Meter high temple was built in1564 and it only suffered minor damage in the earth quake. of 2015.
401,Degu Taleju Temple,Religious Sites,4,Beautiful,"This is part of the wonderful cultural experience of Durbar Square, a Unesco World Heritage site.The building is traditional and beautiful, It still bears scars from the eathquake in 2015. However, mostly it has been restored so this building is now in a much better condition than a lot of others which are still being re-built.A must-see place to visit along with the whole of the Durbar Square area."
402,Degu Taleju Temple,Religious Sites,4,Temple,There are many temples to appreciate and see while visiting Kathmandu.  The stories associated with each temple are always interesting.
403,Degu Taleju Temple,Religious Sites,4,Reconstruction has not started,"An important temple, the Degu Taleju Temple, is far from being reconstructed after the 2015-earthquake. It is not clear when it will happen as several bodies are supposed to be fixing it with money coming from various sources including the Japanese Government."
404,Degu Taleju Temple,Religious Sites,4,Restored mostly,There is still rubble that is being recovered for original pieces that are used to restore as much of these site to as much to original as possible.
405,Degu Taleju Temple,Religious Sites,4,Historic,This is one of the historic durbar squares of Kathmandu. Temple is dedicated to the Lord Taleju. Impact of earthquake can be felt.
406,Degu Taleju Temple,Religious Sites,4,Very special religious monument,"Its the highest structure of those times, and massive temple, but is open only once a year on Dussera, so cannot be seen"
407,Cathedral of th Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary,"Religious Sites, Churches and Cathedrals",5,Christmas Eve Mass,"I have been wanting to get to Christmas Mass here for three years and finally made it there tonight. It is difficult to find and to find a mass schedule. With the help of Phuri from Himalayan Friends Trekking, we got there for the whole mass and some wonderful carols before time. It was amazing!  We are blessed. I attended with my husband, son and his fiance."
408,Cathedral of th Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary,"Religious Sites, Churches and Cathedrals",5,A prime example of inculturation,"I found myself in Kathmandu on a Sunday and went to the English Mass at 9:00 a.m. The church is about 30 minutes away from Thamel by taxi (it took us slightly longer due to the road blocks set up on the occasion of the Chinese President's visit).From the outside, the church looks like any other church that you would find in other parts of the world. However, when you step inside, you will see how they have wonderfully combined elements of Eastern and Western architecture.Most of the congregation squats on cushions on the floor. Those who cannot take this position can sit on the chairs at the edges of the mats. I marvelled at the stained glass windows, paintings and chandeliers as I waited for Mass to begin.If there was anything I would change about the experience, it would be the music. Somehow liturgical music played on an electric guitar did not match the atmosphere of the place. Otherwise, I was glad to have taken the effort to visit this cathedral."
409,Cathedral of th Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary,"Religious Sites, Churches and Cathedrals",5,Very nice church,I took part in the mass on 13th January in the church. The mass starts at 9 am. It was very nice mass. We came from Naya Bazar and paid 400 Rs (one side).
410,Cathedral of th Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary,"Religious Sites, Churches and Cathedrals",5,Christian Refuge in the Capital City,"This church is a bit hard to find.  We eventually got there.  Once I was there, I felt instant peace.  It is a beautiful Catholic church that offered Mass at 9am on Sundays, at least when we visited.  There are a few chairs but most people visiting for the service sit on mats on the ground.  That was a new and welcoming experience.  The pastor and helpers were very welcoming and the service was similar to other Catholic services.  The grounds were very nice with gardens, flowers, statuettes and Nepali designs.  I highly recommend visiting this cathedral whether you are Catholic or not."
411,Cathedral of th Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary,"Religious Sites, Churches and Cathedrals",5,Orderly and Tranquil,"Although it took some effort to locate it, we are glad that we attended the 9am Sunday mass. The place was filled with tranquility and was the beautifully managed. Be sure to tell the driver you want to find the church in Dhobigot (Dhoby Ghaut) to find it in a narrow alley off the main road."
412,Cathedral of th Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary,"Religious Sites, Churches and Cathedrals",5,Thank you!,Was a comforting experience to go to sunday Mass after a mini-expedition climbing Mt Langdak. We asked the priest to thank for the survival of my wife after an accident and for the eternal rest of the kitchenboy who passed away due to acute HAI. We felt home in the serene enclosure. Was impressed by the mix of Nepali and catholic culturen especially in the painting and arcitecture. A must see!
413,Cathedral of th Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary,"Religious Sites, Churches and Cathedrals",5,Beautiful Church,The Cathedral of the Blessed Assumption is a beautiful place of worship. The liturgy was well planned with beautiful singing. The community are very welcoming and were happy to invite visitors for a cup of coffee after Mass. Mass in English is at 9.00am on Sunday Morning.
414,Cathedral of th Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary,"Religious Sites, Churches and Cathedrals",5,A Holy Place,"The Cathedral was hard to locate initially , I was grateful for other people's posts regarding mass times. No one I asked was even aware that there was a Catholic Church despite the long association between the missions and the hospitals and schools.It was a very meaningful visit for me. I loved Nepal and the people, I visited the ruined temples and saw the devastation caused by the earthquakes and poverty. The  Nepalese are very resilient and friendly people. However I needed this space to focus on my own beliefs and thoughts away from the bustling Kathmandu streets with the numerous beggars and disarray. I found it here. I was relieved to be able to contribute to the church community fund so that it could target areas of need identified in the community. This may not be a spectacular building but it is a remarkably peaceful and welcoming one with  an interesting history. Certainly not your conventional Cathedral. Not having a chair to sit on was odd at first but also humbling. The priest gave a lovely homily, most of the readers seemed to be expats ( they knew where the chairs could be found, lol). I will be going back to Kathmandu, hopefully after the rainy season, and attending Holy Mass in this church. It was a wonderful experience."
415,Cathedral of th Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary,"Religious Sites, Churches and Cathedrals",5,Mass time,"As everyone writes - mass is at 9:00 on Sunday.Very nice place. Clean and calm- totally different than the rest of the city. Here you can feel God, here you can simmer down :)"
416,Cathedral of th Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary,"Religious Sites, Churches and Cathedrals",5,Mass time verification,"I also had difficulty contacting the church, but Germone's information was correct -- Sunday Mass is at 9 am!"
417,Seto Machindranath Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Fantastic Little Find!,"Accidentally walked into this amazing little square which holds the Seto Machindranath Temple while exploring Ason Bazaar,  Definitely worth visiting if in the area.  Lots of little details and clearly a very living community."
418,Seto Machindranath Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Beautiful structure,This temple was near to our hotel in Thamel and on way to Durbar Marg. It is small Buddhist temple with beautiful decoration with golden jewellery.
419,Seto Machindranath Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,another beautiful temple in Kathmandu,"This temple is located between Thamel and Durbar Square, but already more near Durbar Square. Its not easy to find, but he is worth it to search for. Especially the golden ornaments are very beautiful. Its also an active temple, so here you get also in touch with the local people."
420,Seto Machindranath Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Beautiful,"Like all the temples and shrines in Kathmandu, beautifully decorated and vibrantly alive. Best seen in a walking tour (we did self guided with ease) of Thamel/ Old Kathmandu."
421,Seto Machindranath Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Nice temple,This temple is located near Thamel. It is a small Buddhist temple. Need some guidance from locals to locate it
422,Seto Machindranath Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,"Less tourists, better experience",Go in the early morning to experience the prayings. Really nice!Make a round and burn some candles.
423,Seto Machindranath Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,"Fascinating, ornate temple","The distance between Durbar Square center and the start of the Ason Bazaar chouk is about 0.4 mile along Siddhidas Marg.  Half-way (about 0.2 mile) between Durbar Square and Ason bazaar, at the junction Kel Tole, is the Jana Bahal temple (also known as Seto Machindranath Temple or the Golden Temple).  This temple was one of our favorites.  The entrance may be moved during construction so walk around the corner."
424,Seto Machindranath Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,On the way from Durbar Square to Thamel,"Ornate, exquisite, detailed, and beautiful. Easily accessible as it is close to both Durbar Square and Thamel."
425,Seto Machindranath Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Temple in Thamel,"Seto Macchendranath is a Buddhist temple in Thamel. The entrance is not easy to find, since the entrance gate is under reconstruction. The brilliant building is worth taking a look. Around the temple, there are many pigeons."
426,Seto Machindranath Temple,Religious Sites,4.5,Beautiful place to visit,Its one of the nice temples to visit.. Very beautiful architecture and embiance.. A must visit temple in Nepal
427,Nagi Gompa,Religious Sites,4.5,Busy school of Buddhism,"Beautiful, welcoming shrine room for meditating, active gompa with a strong lineage, and a lovely hike to get there.  Not a top tourist site but especially wonderful if it has meaning for you.  I didn't meet anyone who spoke English."
428,Nagi Gompa,Religious Sites,4.5,Yoga retreat,Best escape from regular routine into the deep greenery. The forest the calmness the fresh air the great Ani the great yoga vibes. Padma samvab monastery.
429,Nagi Gompa,Religious Sites,4.5,Buddhist Ritual,"I got an opportunity to guide some of the western buddhist students to attend a ritual dance performed by the nun residing here. It was beautiful day and the view from here, seeing the Kathmandu valley is fascinating. The Nunnery is linked to the White monastery in Boudha, and you can inquire the special program being held here."
430,Nagi Gompa,Religious Sites,4.5,Stunning place in a gorgeous national park.,"I went to this site on a guided tour - the tour guide wasn't great (he had no information whatsoever about the monastery), but the site is well worth seeing. It's a 2 km hike up into the hills (with a 420-stair climb at the end) - the National Park made us hire a nature guide at the gate, but that was worth it - Dipesh was very friendly, spoke great English, and was knowledgeable about all the birds and plant species (saw a lot of beautiful birds!). The monastery itself is beautiful, especially the temple where the nuns pray, and the scenery at the top of the hills is spectacular."
431,Nagi Gompa,Religious Sites,4.5,I found peace,"It was the best day while I was in Kathmandu last Feb 2017. A Nepali friend took me to Shivapuri, and I really really feel that Shivapuri is a nice place to look at stunning view of Kathmandu valley eventhough it was hazy at the time. And he told me to go up to the monastery which I have no idea what the name is. Once I step at the main prayer area, I only feel the tranquility. The good thing was the nun offered us for meal as they know we are waiting for mini store to open and buy some snacks cos were hungry. It was such a good heart and kindness that truly touch me. I felt peace surround me, the tranquility gives me enlightment until today. And now I know that the name is Nagi Gompa. Dhanyavda..."
432,Nagi Gompa,Religious Sites,4.5,A Monastery in the Peaceful location,"A place where you get the practical experience of a peaceful mind. After a comfortable hike of 1-5 hrs, its easily accessible where you get the best of the spiritual experience of the lifetime. Simply be there and be immersed with the experience of the life time."
433,Nagi Gompa,Religious Sites,4.5,a wonderful nunnery on the edge of the Valley,"The nuns at Nagi Gompa are a very fine group of practitioners and very friendly as well. A few speak English although they might be shy about it. The road, bad as always, from Budhanilkantha goes all the way into the nunnery grounds these days. Some local taxis who are familiar with the way are able to take people up, but for a more comfortable (albeit expensive) ride, a 4-wheel drive vehicle is preferable."
434,Nagi Gompa,Religious Sites,4.5,A lovely nunnery and nice day hike,"A lovely nunnery in the hills, slightloff the beaten path but worth the hike.I really enjoyed the walk from Budhanilkantha through the forest (the shade from the summer sun ws welcome) up to the nunnery. It took about an hour and a half from memory (didn't time it accurately) and is a failry stiff climb in places but there is a road that gets closer.The nunnery is well situated with god views over the Kathmandu valley. A friendly nun showed me around and the main prayer hall is quite impressive. The quake did cause some damage to an accommodation block but the place seemed Ok otherwise.The fit and enthusiatic could continue up to Shivapuri Peak."
435,Nagi Gompa,Religious Sites,4.5,It is just amazing trip !!!,"I still remember the day I went with my friends in summer. We hiked from budhanilkantha to the monastery. We took challenge that not going from main road, rather we went from jungle where we saw some deers and birds, lucky not to see leopard. When we reached there after one and half hour hike we just felt wahhhhh!!!!!The view was amazing!!!"
436,Nagi Gompa,Religious Sites,4.5,Day Trip to Nagi Gompa,"From my room  i can see  Nagi Gompa very clearly so me along with my friend just thought of visiting Gompa  ,we didn't know the way we just walk upward to hills and walked for more than 3 hour we where tired but the view that we saw while walking was fantastic and finally we reach our destination and i found that it was very peaceful and beautiful Gompa. The view that i loved most was the view of Kathmandu valley which we could see while walking uphills."
437,Casino Royale,Casinos,3.5,Disappointed,It's closed when I visited. Nice hotel but was told by someone that it's closed permanently. Other options are also available but now few of them charge money.
438,Casino Royale,Casinos,3.5,A fine fine casino,This was actually my first visit to a casino and I just loved the vibe and the atmosphere. The food was good too out there and a nice atmosphere
439,Casino Royale,Casinos,3.5,Food for free but casino it is not!,"Good things first, its only reserved for tourists, the food is free and so are the drinks (provided you push the staff), there are dance performances which you can watch for entertainment. Good things end here. The place is small, tables are old, staff is unhelpful, all the people who play are mostly regulars and its not easy to mesh with them, the tables are crowded so its difficult to place a bet, food is not worth the standard of even a medium hotel, in short it was a BAD experience."
440,Casino Royale,Casinos,3.5,Small Casino with no so friendly staff,"This is a small casino and does not have much space... services are poor, seems machine is fixed. Our kids did not enjoyed and left in less than 30 mins."
441,Casino Royale,Casinos,3.5,"CASINO, IS THIS A JOKE?","We have been in a lot of casionos around the world and this is not consider to be a casino. Small place in a hall part of the hotel divided by some old and dirty curtains. Very bad smell over the who place. Just a few old slots machines not working properly as every 1-2 mins the screen was shutting down.Very rude stuff, bad enriromnment and for sure we will never ever go back."
442,Casino Royale,Casinos,3.5,Casino in a Banquet hall,We happen to visit the place on a Sunday night with great expectations only to be royally disappointed with our decision. The place was anything but hardly a casino with old worn out interiors and absolutely bad music. Imagine listening to SRK's Raam Jaane songs still being played here in 2018. Food is super expensive and so were drinks. Could not spend more than 40mins and was out for good. Our unanimous vote for this place was thumbs down.
443,Casino Royale,Casinos,3.5,Gambling,"Naah, I didn't like it at all I mean everything talking about tables chips, interiors it's old, worn-out even the food served is not good at all."
444,Casino Royale,Casinos,3.5,Not my cup of tea,Since it was located in the hotel where we stayed just went to check. Permission only after thorough check and no cover charges. Nicely laid out and staff explain the game clearly but minimum is 500rs.
445,Casino Royale,Casinos,3.5,Total Gamble and what not!,"Best Casino ive ever visited and in good locality.I visited it on Christmas eve and it was proper fun!Dinner and breakfast buffet was served free of cost!You can easily buy chips from Indian currency and get change easily,return is also very simple!No locals were allowed.Must visit casino in Nepal."
446,Casino Royale,Casinos,3.5,Casino,Nepal is famous for its casino and some time can be spent here as a tourist attraction. Try your luck at your own risk
447,Freak Street(Jhhonchen Tole),Points of Interest and Landmarks,3,A bleak peak at the street of Freak - maybe past its prime?,"Im not actually sure what we were supposed to be seeing. It sort of looked like any other street in the area and it ran parallel to Kathmandu Durbar Square. We were there during the day, perhaps more happens at night."
448,Freak Street(Jhhonchen Tole),Points of Interest and Landmarks,3,Insignificant-Bring Back The Freaks,Freak Street was well passed its best and was another quite uninteresting street. Entry from the Durbah Square is via a number of destroyed temples and this is no activity at all compared to what it may have been in the hippie era in the 1960 's and 1970's.Not really worthwhile visiting.
449,Freak Street(Jhhonchen Tole),Points of Interest and Landmarks,3,I like Freak Street,This street was always in my wish list from the 60s and 70s but sadly never made it. Now it's very similar to many other local streets. But still I like to walk along Freak Street and imagine what it must have been like all those years ago. There is a cake and coffee shop there called the Snowman which is open and reputedly used a hang out for the hippies. It's got loads of atmosphere and covers two floors. Sit there and imagine.
450,Freak Street(Jhhonchen Tole),Points of Interest and Landmarks,3,Not a very happening place,"This place seems to have been past its best. I would rather go to Thamel, its much more lively and chaotic 9not sure if thats a good thing!)Dont recommend"
451,Freak Street(Jhhonchen Tole),Points of Interest and Landmarks,3,Not hot as Thamel street,The freak street used to be popular in last decade I think but now there is no hustlin no more shops so you can cancel this street from your places to visit list
452,Freak Street(Jhhonchen Tole),Points of Interest and Landmarks,3,Boring!,Boring is an understatement. There are a few identical trinket shops and an electrical shop selling old style cube tv's wth more dust than the Sahara on them. Hugely disappointing.
453,Freak Street(Jhhonchen Tole),Points of Interest and Landmarks,3,The old street of Kathmandu once called the hippies junction,"The street filled with lights, music, people, restaurants, foods, culture embedded on walls of houses, and a melody of history!"
454,Freak Street(Jhhonchen Tole),Points of Interest and Landmarks,3,Nothing special,"By the time I had reached the end of the street, I could not recall one shop/thing of interest. No traffic allowed in part of it."
455,Freak Street(Jhhonchen Tole),Points of Interest and Landmarks,3,Back to the future after 40 years.,"It is a great disappointment. The atmosphere is gone, and, so have travellers, cafes, and, camping shops, where you could buy, and, sell anything of worth. There remains little to remind one of a crazy bygone era.  The pollutants of the mind, via reefers, chillums, bongs, and, hookahs, have been replaced by those of automobiles, tuk tuts, motor bikes, and, scooters. Thamel is now the new tourist hub. Thanks for the memories, it was a great time, and, place to experience back in the seventies."
456,Freak Street(Jhhonchen Tole),Points of Interest and Landmarks,3,Good to visit while in Durbar Square,"This leads off Kathmandu Durbar Square, great to visit while you're there.  Quite a few places to eat & drink, but not much going on here any more."
457,Aarya Ghat,Points of Interest and Landmarks,4,cremation place,its located in the yard of Pashupatinath temple where cremation takes place. not a very clean and happy place.  u will see mourning ppl and many ppl seeling choros and ganza.
458,Aarya Ghat,Points of Interest and Landmarks,4,Interesting Scary-ish Place to Visit,This is a cremation place and you can watch the process live. Its an extraordinary experience to get to watch this.
459,Aarya Ghat,Points of Interest and Landmarks,4,An interesting spot to visit,"Its a little walk up from the carpark, walk through some markets en route. You need to pay 1000 to enter the main temple area (unrelated to the cremations), in this area you can see traditional dressed monks etc and plenty of monkeys.Walk back out and over the bridge and you can witness the cremations. We waited about 30 mins and one begun, a very surreal experience"
460,Aarya Ghat,Points of Interest and Landmarks,4,Place of Worship and Cremation,"This area by the Bagmati River is where open air cremations are held on the river banks by the Pashupatinath Temple.   Non-hindu visitors may watch from outside, across the river from the temple.  They are not permitted inside the temple.  It is near the airport and made an easy first stop on our arrival."
461,Aarya Ghat,Points of Interest and Landmarks,4,evening worship,"Recommended to visit at evening 7 pm, There is puja(worship) where you can feel little different. Recommended to attend this place."
462,Aarya Ghat,Points of Interest and Landmarks,4,A Unique Experience,"Each cremation is but a part of the mosaic of life along the Bagmati River.  Next to ongoing cremation rituals, the funeral workers, members of the lowest caste, build the pyres out of logs in preparation the next cremation that will happen with certainty. For cremations, where the mourners the mourners have left other than for some male relatives maintain a vigil, other funeral workers tend to the fires with long poles to ensure that all the remains are consumed by the purifying fire.  The two pedestrian bridges are jammed and lined with people - Nepalese as well as foreigners witnessing it all and photographing it all.  Behind the pyres, in the areas accessible only to Hindus, people can be scene entering shrines and temples as part of practicing their faith. The hillside on the east side of the river is covered with tourists congregating about the Sadhhus who are to found amongst the shrines to Shiva.  Further up the hillside, families are enjoying the view of it all from an overlook while enjoying snacks and beverages from the refreshment stand.  Life continues with the players all playing their roll of the moment and often oblivious to the others. I will return again to Kathmandu to witness and document the Hindu funerals but more importantly, to better understand the details and nuances of the ritual."
463,Aarya Ghat,Points of Interest and Landmarks,4,An Experience,Interesting cultural experience on how the Hindi cremate there loved ones at death.There is a $10 entrance fee but I have been told a lot of that money goes toward helping pay for costs involved in cremating the poor families loved ones.There are a few different viewing points to see the different stages of the ritual.Be aware of the fake holy men as the will try to con you out of money.
464,Aarya Ghat,Points of Interest and Landmarks,4,Where spiritual journey begins,A place where one can review the whole life infront of their own eyes. A dark and cold but truthful revelation that no matter how powerful or rich or famous you are the end result is ashes and smoke. A humbling experience that teaches to be good and do good to others while one is alive. A must place to visit.
465,Aarya Ghat,Points of Interest and Landmarks,4,Culture and Religion : A rich experience,"I have to say that aside from the intricately designed temples and magnificent colors, the most surprising and interesting experience for me was seeing the burial rights. They build a pyre and burn the body at the side of the river then push the ashes into the water. Like fire and water as a cleansing for the afterlife.However if you have a delicate constitution and seeing dead bodies being burn while crows circle around and occassionally take a piece of chard flesh is not acceptable to you, then I suggest you skip this and keep to looking at the marvelous architectural design of the temples within the complex. It will still be worth the $10 entrance fee you have to pay."
466,Basantapur Dabali,"Points of Interest and Landmarks, Architectural Buildings",4,Market area in Durbar Square,We visited this small market area as part of our tour of Kathmandu Durbar Square - and came away with a tiger/sheep game after some bartering of course!
467,Basantapur Dabali,"Points of Interest and Landmarks, Architectural Buildings",4,Historical Center Of Kathmandu-History And Sights,"This is the also known as Durbah Square and is square in front of the fomer Royal Palace of the Kingdom Of Kathmandu and is the historical center of the city and although the April 2015 earthquake destroyed a number of buildings this is a place of history, crowds, sights and senses. and not to be missed. The area is full of elaborate old buildings and temples and interesting people."
468,Basantapur Dabali,"Points of Interest and Landmarks, Architectural Buildings",4,Restoration of heritage city,"The place has history of ancient archeology and engineering which has proved that its more scientific from that time. However earthquake of 2015 has hit whole city to destruction, perhaps few time ahead, whole city will be back after restoration and tourists can view more realistic view very soon."
469,Basantapur Dabali,"Points of Interest and Landmarks, Architectural Buildings",4,Visited  with student group,"Very nice ancient historical place,looks very beautiful.Really felt best refreshed when we visited this place."
470,Basantapur Dabali,"Points of Interest and Landmarks, Architectural Buildings",4,Thronging Marketplace,"A touristy place that is, nonetheless, a delight to visit and experience. It is essentially a marketplace with established businesses setting shop along the periphery of the square and the famous open-air souvenir/artifact stalls in the middle. Very enjoyable indeed."
471,Basantapur Dabali,"Points of Interest and Landmarks, Architectural Buildings",4,Place to stay live.,Basantpur Dabali is wide open place next to living goddess resistance in Kathmandu Durbar square. People can just stay relax and watching  people passers-by  and activities to stay live. At this place there is a flea market of handicrafts where people can buy interesting stuff to fit your empty space at home on bargaining  price. To get there for tourists they have to entrance fee of 10 $ or Rs 1000/-  once you get there you see old place as well.
472,Basantapur Dabali,"Points of Interest and Landmarks, Architectural Buildings",4,Basantapur Dabali,".The Basantapur Dabali Square is an open area near Freak Street and the Darbur Square complex that functions, among other things, as an open-air souvenir market. It also serves to be the gathering place for festivals and large-group meetings. With the vendors all lined up to one side facing the exit from Darbur Square, it has an open and welcoming ambiance to the place, hawkers eagerly awaiting for tourists and visitors alike filing out of the square after touring the famous Kathmandu POI.  Mind you, the souvenir vendors are not aggressive at all, even allowing you to look over their wares without accosting you. Compared to, say, Asian sellers or Arab touts, these Nepali vendors are as meek and docile as sheep. Now, having said that, it is quite touristy for my taste -- with the prices to match. (As of this writing, the place has largely escaped unscathed from the April 2015 earthquake.) Not exactly an exciting place but, being close to Darbur Square and free of charge, still is worth a short peek. Grade B-plus.."
473,Taragaon Museum,History Museums,4.5,Limited but interesting...,"...so if youre in the area, especially if staying in the same compound at the Hyatt Regency, then you should definitely visit. Not every section was open but what there was I found very diverting, particularly some of the first European artists impressions of Nepal and the striking photography of people and nature."
474,Taragaon Museum,History Museums,4.5,Good place to visit for exhibition,"The museum is simple and minimalist in a tranquil environment. It has pictures, paintings and sketches of Kathmandu valley and Nepal done by Nepali and international artists. The building is unique with small galleries with such pictures and paintings that depicts the changes in the Kathmandu Valley. It also has an exhibition hall where different exhibition happens frequently. There is a cafe- Flavors Cafe and Buddhism College as well in the premise. Every Saturday 9 AM to 12 PM there is organic farmers market in its parking area. The entry to the museum is free."
475,Taragaon Museum,History Museums,4.5,A must visit in Kathmandu,"There are so many museums and heritage sites in Kathmandu, that everybody knows about but Taragaon is one of its kind. Not many people within the city know about this place but you have to visit it to believe it. The museum houses drawings, sketches,paintings and other important documents that dates back in history. All of the photographs and sketches that are housed in the museum are donated by the artists themselves."
476,Taragaon Museum,History Museums,4.5,Beautiful but not a must-see for travelers,"It really is a beautiful place and it's more quiet compared to the noisy and busy areas of the other temples and museums. The Taragaon Museum houses photographs of the Kathmandu Valley and the Mustang People. There is a very beautiful restaurant there too where you can chill and escape from the city. However, I found this just okay. It's nothing super special so if you're thinking of squeezing this in your busy itinerary, just skip it. You won't need an hour to go around this place unless you're going to the restaurant."
477,Taragaon Museum,History Museums,4.5,Wow.,"I dont understand why this isnt a more popular attraction in Kathmandu. It could be because it is on the same land as the Hyatt Regency complex? Anyway, the art and photographic works are fantastic, but more so the architecture is beautiful - I understand it used to be a hotel. Theres a cafe/bar onsite and I dare say you could have a very relaxing afternoon here."
478,Taragaon Museum,History Museums,4.5,An oasis,"This sweet museum offered one to take a breath and enjoy the beauty among the bustle of crowded streets near Boudhanath.  We marveled at the gallery show.  The statues and artwork woven from water hyacinth were delightful.  Learning about the preservation of cranes was so important.  We viewed a photography exhibit showing cranes (from Viet Nam) whose wings were cropped off, so that the birds could be pets.  Thanks to one man's efforts to stop this from happening.  Thanks to Taragaon Museum for displaying this important work.  A pleasure to visit!"
479,Taragaon Museum,History Museums,4.5,Fascinating Scene,A futuristic fantasy architecture art museum with revolving art shows in a beautiful setting next to the grand Hyatt Hotel - a short walk from historic Baudha stupa.
480,Taragaon Museum,History Museums,4.5,Interesting architectural museum,"This is a museum of drawings and photos of the architecture of kathmandu valley and some of the restorations performed. This is a series of small galleries. No guides, No gift shop, no fee Fascinating images not much interpretation for the visitor"
481,Taragaon Museum,History Museums,4.5,Through the past of Kathmandu visually,"Kathmandu was not opened up for foreigners until 1951.  The Taragaon museum is accessible via the Hyatt Regency and also from the street.  We found it because we were staying at the Hyatt Regency Kathmandu.  The museum has many rooms with photographs, sketches, etchings and other documents from the period from 1951 throught the 60's and 70's predominately.  It shows how untouched Kathmandu was.  In 1951, there were not roads that could support a car - only foot traffic known to locals.  The photographs are visually stunning.  If you stay at the Hyatt Regency Kathmandu, you'll see many of the photographs on the walls showing the Nepalese life during this period.There also is a small cafe available to tourists for drinks and snacks.There are also a few artifacts from the 1800's on display.  This museum opened in 2014 and is a rare treat from the past."

492,Chhango Adventure Canyoning In Nepal,Sports Camps and Clinics,5,Must do experience for Katmandu,"After tracking in Nepal looking for other exciting yet less intensive activities, doing canyoning in the special place at the park, less than an hour away driving from Thamel. Quite and beautiful place, professional guidance and an amazing experience, absolutely one of the highlights here at Katmandu "
493,Chhango Adventure Canyoning In Nepal,Sports Camps and Clinics,5,"Exploring Adventure canyoning in Kathmandu, Nepal","After doing many adventure sports, i found out i had the best experience in canyoning, not just because of activity but also due to the professional guidance from Chhango Team as well. Feeling Lucky and blessed and it is the activity that should be done while you are in Kathmandu Valley. Thank you @Chhango Team. :) :)"
494,Chhango Adventure Canyoning In Nepal,Sports Camps and Clinics,5,Very Enjoyable,"My friend and I went Canyoning with Kishor and the guide Sandip and were very happy with his professionalism, safety awareness and photo-taking skills  This was our first time Canyoning & Kishor did his very best to make us feel at ease, checking in with us often to see if we were feeling okay. He was very approachable and friendly and we had some good laughs! Wetsuits, jackets, mid-adventure coffee and lunch were provided. The experience was great value in my opinion! Thanks Kishor & Sandip "
495,Chhango Adventure Canyoning In Nepal,Sports Camps and Clinics,5,True Adventure!,"We went Canyoning with Kishor Shahi, which was recommended by FlyEast Nepal back in March 2017 after doing an EBC trek. We had an extra day after our trek to explore around Kathmandu and have fun. We decided to do canyoning, and Kishor was very professional and provided a safe and fun atmosphere. We had two extra guides helping out and enjoyed our initial hike through the National Park then the canyoning. Kishor has years of experience and provided us with food, wetsuits, and great stories. We highly recommend if you have an extra day to get out of the city and have an adventure."
496,Chhango Adventure Canyoning In Nepal,Sports Camps and Clinics,5,EXCITING AND FUN,"Had my first canyoning experience there! Was really a fun and exciting moment, Loved it! I recommend to try this out! :)"
497,Chhango Adventure Canyoning In Nepal,Sports Camps and Clinics,5,Rock climbing,"Amazing experience! The guide was excellent, very experienced, really cares about safety, his English was very good and that was important since that was my first time of rock climbing. You have many levels of rock climbing in Nagarjun Reservation area near Kathmandu, and we went to the beginners level and it was challenging for me, but Karma (the guide) kept motivating me and eventually I made it to the top! :) Also I learnt how to make the knots and many interesting stuff about climbing methods. After that we had a bonus - driving in his motobike around Kathmandu valley, which was a full-adrenaline-experience for itself ;)"
498,Chhango Adventure Canyoning In Nepal,Sports Camps and Clinics,5,Awesome and Extreme adventures! An agency that fit your needs,"Me and my friend love extreme sports and physical challenging adventures. Chhango provided that. We made a Deal with the agency to do both canyoning, mountainbiking and rockclimbing to a affordable Price. We made it clear that we loved challenges and didn't Want any beginners level, because we had done all of the things before (but not much though).We then Got a hole Day of canyoning down waterfalls, which went op to 40 meters of repelling. And the water was poring Down on us and the rocks were slippery; quite challenging but extremely fun! The guide was professional and very experienced. The equipment were a bit old, but still fine enough for the purpose. The next day we went mountainbiking around the himalayain mountains around Kathmandu for almost 8 hours! The bikes was in perfect konditions. All new Trek mountaibikes. On The third day we rockclimbed for several hours. Very fun and the guide was very friendly and spoke good english (same guys as the first day).Don't expect too much of the Food provided, but it suffices."
499,Chhango Adventure Canyoning In Nepal,Sports Camps and Clinics,5,Canyoning,"The agency was recommended to me by another recommended agency from Lonely planet. Kishor is a handsome guide, his life is canyoning.First I thought his suggestion would not be adventurous enough for me, but it turned out to be perfect for me. Is was awesome. Extreme enough, technical enough and special enough to set my pic from the waterfall as my Facebook profile photo )))Safe, great location, interesting and adventurous, i can definitely recommend this agency!Two words on Kishor, he's a cool guy, with dissent English, very pleasant and caring. He showed me around, on his motorcycle, just to make a good impression of Nepal, explained a lot about Kathmandu and showed me some tamales just to satisfy my curiosityI strongly recommend him and his canyoning (and mountain bike) agency!"
500,Chhango Adventure Canyoning In Nepal,Sports Camps and Clinics,5,Beautiful Adventurous Canyoning with Team,Life is all about to do the things which you never did beforeTaking the risk was in option but first one was our passion.And that was a time when i first heard about Chhango Nepal which stretched me to do something adventurous trip and i found it as Canyoning with my colleagues.Kishore dai an amazing soul and his rules as well (do it otherwise die) and thank you Chhango Nepal for those spectacular remembrance.And Prajeena and Arujan all thanks to you for putting on with my insanity during trip.
501,Chhango Adventure Canyoning In Nepal,Sports Camps and Clinics,5,Canyoning in Nepal,"""Jobs fill your pocket, adventures fill your soul"".           Jaime Lyn Beatty Yes, definitely Chhango Nepal had filled our soul with that adventurous trip. We had great time doing the canyoning. Firstly, I was sacred but Kishore dai guide me and give me the strength. And that was so amazing falling from middle of the stream. Thank you Chhango Nepal for those life time moments."
502,Bouddha Stupa Thanka Center,Art Galleries,4,Watch out tourist trap,"Be firm. They will teach you about the paintings which is nice but they wont let you leave easily without buying one. Guides bring people here and clearly get a cut of the price. We purchased one because they are nice but I felt pressured to get one for myself and had to say a firm no with an awkward silence following. After this trip we saw these things in shops everywhere. There were another half-dozen occasions on our trip where someone attempted to take us into a school but thankfully by this point we knew better. Pity, the people in this temple were well versed and friendly."
503,Bouddha Stupa Thanka Center,Art Galleries,4,Beautiful Artwork,Our guide took us here and were we glad he did. The paintings are beautiful. The colors are vibrant and the work whether done by a master or student was excellent. I bought a small painting and it was carefully rolled and placed I side a tube for easy packing.
504,Bouddha Stupa Thanka Center,Art Galleries,4,Interesting,They provided a history of this type of artwork. Pointed out how each piece of art is created: from canvas prep to the final signature. Its more than just art.
505,Bouddha Stupa Thanka Center,Art Galleries,4,Learn about Thanka Painting and expect a hard sell to buy one,"I am in awe of Buddhist practices and eager to learn all I can about their religion.  It's been something that I've had an interest in since childhood and in 50+ years it's not wavered.  I would have willingly paid a small fee for a tour of this facility, but our guide brought us here and said there would be no fee.  It was fascinating to learn the process and feel hands-on the artwork.  After the tour and watching artists at work, we were hard pressed to purchase something which we hadn't planned on upon entering.  My husband would buy trinkets from every trip, if I left more room in the suitcase and we already have more stuff in our house than we need.  When we attempted to negotiate a price, the woman kept looking to our guide and we understood that he was getting a cut of the sale."
506,Bouddha Stupa Thanka Center,Art Galleries,4,Great paintings,We were lucky enough to see students painting beautiful Mandalas and other religeous paintings. You can purchase those done by students and masters.
507,Bouddha Stupa Thanka Center,Art Galleries,4,Vacation,This time I came katmandu for my winter vacation. M with my mom came here for our vacation m feel so blessed to visit such a wonderful place its was soo awesome place we feel peace n pleasure
508,Bouddha Stupa Thanka Center,Art Galleries,4,Interesting Tourist Trap,"Absolutely fascinating to see how these thanka paintings are made, and also to learn about how to discern the various qualities of these paintings, not to mention to see the artists in action and to be able to ask questions galore of the proprietor. Only problem, don't try to leave without buying something. Much as these are beautiful, I really didn't want to buy one, which I wound up doing. Felt coerced. Why can't they just charge an entry fee, and then, should you like to make a purchase, perhaps apply that? Also, can bargain re. price somewhat. Still felt trapped."
509,Kaiser Library,Libraries,4,Loved the dusty old books,"The books are all squashed together in a couple of rooms in the old palace, due to earthquake damage. I love books and was fascinated by the random collection in the rooms. I could have spent all day browsing. Yes, its quirky and very different to anything else in the city.  There were quite a few students in there reading newspapers or the books. I think it's definitely worth a visit."
510,Kaiser Library,Libraries,4,Excellent park ans cafe to wind down,"Superb place right in the heart of the city, undisturbed by natural beauty, and wide open spaces to relax. Trees all around and a sight behold in the light day showers. Enjoying a cup of coffee in the cafe is bliss.Note: it has an entry fee which is non refundable."
511,Kaiser Library,Libraries,4,Very sad visit,"Alas the earthquake has also affected this beautiful building and the remaining rooms are just a hollow shadow of the previously glorious library. It is free to visit and one should go there, maybe this way they will start renovating the building! Very sad place... go and visit the Garden of dreams afterwards to cheer up!!"
512,Kaiser Library,Libraries,4,Old books but sadly now small library,"Most have been a great place to visit. The 2015 earthquake hit the building hard. Now ground floor only open.  Fred of charge. Very few books cramped in small space. Some nice old books though. Spent an hour reading an 1880 book on Indian caves , very nice. Power cuts are annoying."
513,Kaiser Library,Libraries,4,Former palace turned library,"A former palace, now a library based on the collection of General Kaiser SJB Rana, son of the earlier Maharajah. Houses some old books and manuskripts but much must have been lost over time due to the lack of care and mis management. Where a fine sword and shield should hang is now a chinese toy copy. Still a a place to visit as less n less of the real historical Kathmandu exists. Books they have, may need to search and abit dusty but fun. If studying anything on Nepal a good place to visit. Can always go to garden of dreams otherwise which is basicly next door."
514,Kaiser Library,Libraries,4,Historical building and library,This is a strange gloomy old building  with an antique idea of a library. More a book depository and finding books is not easy. But students come here and it is a unique archive and place of historic interest. Worth a visit.
515,Kaiser Library,Libraries,4,The library is no more,Due to the earthquake the building is very damaged. All the books are gone. There is really nothing to see at this place. It is even too dangerous to wander around the building and the gardens.
516,Kaiser Library,Libraries,4,A good one,"This library is a good one to spend some time alone and reading off your favorite list of books, near the passport office and under ministry of education gives you a whole new adventurous reading"
517,Kaiser Library,Libraries,4,huge,"its an huge library, it actually a palace turned into library, being a book lover i was amazed by its size and the collection it had one can sit anywhere in the huge palace to read."
518,Kaiser Library,Libraries,4,Library only for newspapers,"This historic library has not been reconstructed since 2015 earthquake. All the books are dumped in rucksack. Saw few employees reading newspapers, that's it."
519,Stone Vishnu Mandir Temple,�Architectural Buildings,3,Still awaiting renovation,"This temple, situated right next to the big bell in Durbar Square, Is unfortunately still awaiting renovation nearly four years on from the earthquake in 2015. Presumably priority is being given to other temples first."
520,Stone Vishnu Mandir Temple,�Architectural Buildings,3,Small but Beautiful at Durbar Square,"This temple is one of the many temple in Durbar Square met with the earthquake , restoration work seems to be not that fast here. Don't know the reason behind the same."
521,Maha Vishnu Mandir Temple,Religious Sites3.5,3.5,Vishnu in the Pool,"The Vishnu Mandir we visited is at the outskirt towards north of the town. It is believed that the Vishnu statue in resting posture appeared on its own during a farmer ploughing his land. It is beautiful to see Vishnu lying in bed mid of a pool. Must see place and have a splash of the divine water from the pool by the local priest, during our time it was young boys who were the priests."
522,Rizvi Brothers Paper Mache Gift Shop,Art Galleries,5,Beautiful hand painted paper mache boxes and gifts,"Designed in Kashmir and made in Nepal - beautiful ornate jewelry boxes, animals, decorations etc. I made three trips to this shop to buy presents for me and others!"
523,Woodcraft Gallery,Art Galleries,5,Family works display,Good place to sculptures and photography and paintings exhibition events. Also best place to practice on wood since they teach you wood carving for free on every Saturday 12pm to 3pm. One could make gift for oneself in that hour. You must enroll first and for that have to talk to the Gallery people and then go to training for free on Saturdays. And also share your wood working experience from your professional wood carving work.

526,Handy-Mandy Craft House,Points of Interest & Landmarks,,The most unique hand made items in Nepal,"The elephant and sacred cow and rhino slippers stopped me dead in my tracks!  In another review about the Yak and Yeti Hotel,  I mentioned the wonderful shops just across the street.  For some reason I passed right by this one which was on the other side.   Well, I was in heaven!!  I bought slippers, jewelry, bags and many other items, many crafted from felted wool.  Whimsical, original, colorful and just plain irresistible.  The proprietor was lovely and helpful and made the whole experience delightful."
527,Karmaraja Mahavihara,Religious Sites4.5,4.5,Back in time in Nepal,"How simply beautiful. The areas are all kept beautifully and traditionally. Worth the time to see, and experience the culture through the small sculptures and carvings."

In the early 1970s, the 16th Karmapa stayed here for several months conducting special empowerments, teaching, and giving audience to hundreds of disciples.At present, about sixty monks are accommodated in the monastery. We managed to see the inside , the main altar , and the monk prayers room ,amazing decorations inside out.Worth a visit ,if you are in Swayambunath area."
530,Shree Tanadevi Temple,Religious Sites4.8,4,"A small, very well decorated shakti pitha adjacent to Taleju","Tarini Bhawani (Tana Devi) is a shakti pitha (sacred site where a part of Sati's body fell to earth) with a small, very well decorated temple adjacent to Taleju, recently brightly painted. The central of three excellent torana is gilt. Open one day a year in the fall when a Kumari (not the Raj Kumari of Taleju, Kathmandu has several) is worshipped inside. Bhajan composed to the Goddess are sometimes sung in the evenings here."
531,Bhimsen Sthan Temple,Religious Sites4.9,4,Peccato per la ragnatela di fili elettrici tutto intorno,"Il tempio  abbastanza bello, di legno e molto decorato, peccato che fare belle foto  impossibile, essendo circondato da fili elettrici.E' dedicato alla dea newari Bhimsen che protegge i commercianti e gli artigiani"
532,Chandragiri Hill,"Points of Interest & Landmarks , Lookouts",5,View for the Gods !!!,"You can look at the full Himalayan Range from this place.

Right from Annapurna in the extreme left to M Everest in the extreme right ....all these peaks are well over 6500 Metres to 8900 metres  !!!! you just have to ensure you are there on a clear sunny day thats all.  The cable ride of almost 2.4 Kms is a must do activity ....take in the views all through the ride. You will be do engrossed in the Himalayas that you may forget to view the Kahmandu Valley itself which is breathtaking !"
533,Kotilingeshwor Mahadev Mandir Temple,"Architectural Buildings , Religious Sites",4.5,Distinctive Stone Malla Temple,This Hindu temple is a square stone structure topped by a bell-shaped dome and it goes back toi the 16th century and the reign of the Mahendra Malla.This was located away from the main entrace to what is the northern side a little past the Black Bhairab and is worth a look.
534,Dharmadhaatu Stupa,Religious Sites,4,Temple in the middle of an intersection,Stumbled upon this beauty while going for a evening walk. Its actually quite beautiful. Located in the middle of a four way intersection.
535,Dharmadhaatu Stupa,Religious Sites,4,Worth a Stop,"As you walk from Thamel towards Durbar Square, this charming small stupa stands in a fairly large square. You can enter for a better view and spin prayer wheels that surround the stupa. There is also a mini park around the stupa that may be upen.One of the better kept small stupas in the city."
536,Lucky Traders & Exporter,Shopping Malls,4,Excellent Quality Clothing,"In the sea of venders that is Thamel, this little shop stands out. The quality is excellent and the prices fair. The fibers of cotton are strong and the design detail is elegant. The Female shop keeper is kind and wants all shoppers to look their best! Do seek out this little shop for a nice gift to take home!"
537,Vaisha Dev(Toothache Tree),Religious Sites,4,They have covered it,It's interesting to find this.  It's abit hidden and hard to find.  Have history on it.  But now you won't notice it.  Coz it covered with plastic glass and full of dust.  You wont notice it on a busy road.
538,Vaisha Dev(Toothache Tree),Religious Sites,4,Interesting,interesting place to see on the way to Kathmandu Durbar square from Thamel. Its looks quiet strange seen so many coins attached
539,Vaisha Dev(Toothache Tree),Religious Sites,4,Painless dentistry hopes,"It doesnt cost anything more than a small coin to wish your pain away! And if not, there is a whole neighborhood of practicing dentists nearby!"
540,Vaisha Dev(Toothache Tree),Religious Sites,4,Ummm - interesting!!,This is the shrine to the toothache God and according to locals it works if you have toothache and make an offering when you have toothache it will do (if it doesn't there are lots of dentist on the next street who will help you out!!)
541,Vaisha Dev(Toothache Tree),Religious Sites,4,Tap a coin in to the multitudes and pray,Some people believe that a coin will relieve the pain but if/when that wears off and the pain is still there you can try one of the many dentist shops near by that have very interesting equipment in their display ( some very archaic).
542,Vaisha Dev(Toothache Tree),Religious Sites,4,'When the Tooth Aches',"Frequented by the locals as a 'healing deity of toothache', this open temple lies between Kathmandu Durbar Sqaure and Thamel. When locals have toothache, still today, before going to the dentist they take a small coin of any denomination, make a hole on it and pound onto the log of wood with the help of an iron nail. It is believed that in medieval time there was a tree and a statue here. Now only a piece of log is remained with hundreds of pierced coins and nails remain. It is also good for anyone to bow before this power place to request for prayers for 'health teeth'."
543,Vaisha Dev(Toothache Tree),Religious Sites,4,Surprised.,I saw a pile of coins and when I went close found as if it's a branch of some tree and some numerous coins have been embedded on it. Strange belief when you nail a coin in it your toothache goes away.
544,Vaisha Dev(Toothache Tree),Religious Sites,4,Thousands of coins.,"While roaming around in Thamel, we reached a place where we saw a lots of shops which fix teeth not exactly a dental clinic. Then in sometime we saw a little bump near a wall, and thousands of coins were embedded on that. Then we came to know that if somebody has got toothache. You fix a coin and your ache goes away."
545,Vaisha Dev(Toothache Tree),Religious Sites,4,Strange belief,Vaisha Dev (toothache tree) is a small lump of a tree with lots of coins fixed on it. There is a strange belief that if you have any pain in the tooth. You go fix a coin your pain will go. It is no doubt very strange but people do it. I saw so many people came and touched it and prayed for some time and then left.
546,Vaisha Dev(Toothache Tree),Religious Sites,4,Quirky attraction - tough to find,"Interesting and quirky attraction. Was a little tough to find, the dozen or so locals we asked did not know where it was, but wandering the streets to find it was half the fun! Located on the corner of a street meeting a small square you will see several dentists in the area to let you know you're on the right track. Ultimately the Toothache Tree is little more than a 1-2 metre long old piece of timber with dusty coins nailed to it, hardly very attractive but an interesting thing to find. In the short time we were there, dozens of locals touched the tree and said a little prayer."
547,Music museum of Nepal,Art Museums/History Museums,5,The secret and marvelous museum of music!,"The Museum was founded in the year 1995 with a view of collecting, preserving and glorifying Nepali folk musical instruments. There are more than 100 ethnic groups in Nepal, each with their own culture and traditions to mark every occasion from birth to death with music. The museum holding a collection of 655 distinct Nepali folk musical instruments.Not easy to find, like all treasures, but when you will find it, you will really appreciate it!Martin from Montral, Qubec, Canada"
548,Music museum of Nepal,Art Museums/History Museums,5,Amazing collection and valuable preservation work!,"This was my favorite place to visit during my time in Nepal! The first time I visited, the director, Ram, welcomed me in and showed me the whole museum. I felt so at home there and came back many more times. I hope to stay connected with the museum in the future because it is doing such incredible and valuable work to preserve Nepal's musical heritage. Absolutely wonderful experience!"
549,Music museum of Nepal,Art Museums/History Museums,5,Wonderful heritage,"The Music Museum of Nepal has a rich collection of traditional Nepali instruments -- drums, string instruments, etc.  It is hard to find -- through an alley, around a temple under reconstruction, up a flight of stairs -- but it is worth it to connect with Nepal's musical heritage."
550,Music museum of Nepal,Art Museums/History Museums,5,it is great  to see all nepali folk musical instruments.,it is important to know our  ancestors musical heritage. there many  instruments which we never seen. friendly peoples. if we have time we can play musical instruments in   a small concert hall.
551,Music museum of Nepal,Art Museums/History Museums,5,Fantastic guide and instruments!!,"This museum is amazing. But firstly I'd like to say: museum is hidden inside the Hindu temple (photo of way you need to go is included). As a musician, I can say: you can see a lot of traditional drums and string instruments only here! There are lots of strange and very old ones: and the owner of collection, a very kind man who did a very hard work collecting and restoring them, allows you to play them carefully! It is a fantastic experience, don't miss it!!!"
552,Music museum of Nepal,Art Museums/History Museums,5,A hidden gem - why don’t more people know about this?,We were fortunate enough to have someone who had been here before tell us about this museum. It has hundreds of Nepali instruments. The curator was lovely and had two music students play a concert for us.
553,Music museum of Nepal,Art Museums/History Museums,5,Tremendously important place for the history of Nepali folk music,"To find something related to the traditional culture of Nepal, I stopped at this small museum where locates modestly inside Siva Temple. I was not able to find the place only by the navigation of Google map, as Siva Temple was still in an extensive repair work due to the earthquake and I couldn't find any signs around the temple when I first arrived in the place. However, Ram, the founder of the museum, has kindly run out of the place and picked me up after a phone call to the museum, and hosted me with his passion to the Nepali folk music. You can find quite a lot of introductions about the museum on the web so I will not go into the details here, but what made me so surprised and impressed the most, was this museum holding a collection of 655 distinct Nepali folk musical instruments, as well as a tons of music archives was founded and run individually by Ram without any governmental support! He introduced himself not as a musician (but he's just too humble as he plays Shankha) but an enthusiast of music. Furthermore, he has written one book that shows his deep knowledge to the Nepali folk instruments (he told me it took him to almost 10 years to complete the book, and now he has already started to work on the 2nd book...!). This place is not a fancy museum indeed but should be known to the world to be further supported, as the museum exhibits such historically important items. You can look all the instruments inside the museum within an hour and have a little chat with Ram (of course he will be eager to answer your questions about the Nepali folk music), so please do swing by between your temple tour in Kathmandu."

556,Kathmandu Fun Park,Amusement and Theme Fun Park,4,For kids,Nice place for children..Many rides for different age categories.. You can engage your kid for 3 to 4 hours.. However boat ride is not comfortable even water is not clean..

590,Rani Pokhari(Queen Pond),Scenic walking Areas,3.5,A disappointing sight at the moment,"The pond has been drained which gives a very sad appearance. Renovation seems to be going ahead but a row rumbles in the background. Some of the pond's area has been 'taken' for another purpose and various government departments are squabbling about it. I hope it is restored to its former glory.For the moment, however, it's not worth a special journey but you might be wandering along Kantipath to the south anyway..."
591,Rani Pokhari(Queen Pond),Scenic walking Areas,3.5,Getting Better ....,Such an amazing place ... SO glad they appear to be renovating it . You can only imagine what it used to be like - it is in the heart of Kathmandu and needs to be shown the respect it is due ....

595,Wood craft Gallery,Art Galleries,5,Nice place to learn Nepali Woodcraft,"By accident I heard about the woodcraft workshop on Saturday mornings. The really nice brothers welcome you an give you the possibility to choose your own form to work on. After that they help you by making it the way they do it in Nepal. In the meanwhile they can tell you whatever you want to know about Nepal and their culture. They're also really interested in your culture. After the workshop, that ends when you are ready, they ask you for tips because they want to learn teaching. So I would recommend everybody to go to the Gallery on Saturday at 12 o'clock, it's all for free!"
596,Wood craft Gallery,Art Galleries,5,Amazing place to spend your afternoon,"Really cool place owned by a local family. Definitely worth to stop by if you are staying at somewhere nearby or even just passing by.

For exact location I used Google maps apps and it showed the Gallery in right place in satghumti, in front of annapurna market."

599,Kasthamandap,Religious Sites,4,Under reconstruction,"In common with many of the ancient structures in the central square, this building was damaged in the earthquake in 2015, but in this case it was completely devastated. It is a particularly important building due to its history and thankfully good progress is being made in its reconstruction thanks to Japanese support.And something good has even come from the disaster in terms of archaeological discoveries made in the recovery work."
600,Kasthamandap,Religious Sites,4,Totally Destroyed And Fenced Off,It was located at the entrance to Freak Street and is now just a pile of rubble and is fenced off and there is sadly nothing to see. Hopefully they will restore this wooden shelter from which the name Kathmandu was derived.
601,Kasthamandap,Religious Sites,4,Kasthamandap MEANS Wood-Covered Shelter,"Kasthamandap ""Wood-Covered Shelter"" was a three-storied public shelter that included a shrine consecrated to Gorakshanath situated at Maru, Kathmandu, Nepal. Several myths and stories about the date of the construction of the Kasthamandap Temple have been resolved with the recent archeological findings. The newly discovered objects during the excavation here in the aftermath of the 2015 earthquake have suggested that the Kasthamandap may have been built in the 7th century during the Lichhavi era."
602,Kasthamandap,Religious Sites,4,destroyed in 2015 earthquake,But work is in place to rebuild this as this is the origin of the name Kathmandu. It is a wooden house made from a single tree

The government is planning to rebuild it but the legend says the original was built from one huge tree and this will be difficult to accomplice in modern times.
608,Namkha Khyung Dzong Rigdin Choling Monastery,Religious Sites,5,"Lovely walk to nearby monastery, organised by Shivapuri Heights Cottage","Under the guidance of a local we were hiking from Shivapuri Heights Cottage to the nearby monastery, a beautiful building, where we could even attend the afternoon prayer session of the monks! I really enjoyed this little excursion and was happy about our guide - without him we would probably have lost track. In all, a perfect way to spend the afternoon!Aline (23) from Switzerland"
609,Namkha Khyung Dzong Rigdin Choling Monastery,Religious Sites,5,A rich walk in the hills!,"I have to say that we spent a delightful day taking a guided walking from Shivapuri Heights Cottage up to the monastry and then on and up past a local school to the Kathmandu Valley rim.  This led us through the nearby villages and into the National Park behind Shivapuri Heights Cottage. The views were spectacular and the flora and fauna were rich and diverse: many different bird and butterfly species as well as colourful flowers including orchids. We stopped for a picnic lunch at a luscious waterfall in the forest surrounded by the mesmerising buzz of cicadas.After returning past the nearby farmhouses and exchanging greetings with the friendly locals, we were welcomed back at Shivapuri Heights Cottage with cool drinks and a delicious meal followed by a very comfortable night's sleep.What more could you possibly want?! And this is only 30 mins away from the centre of Kathmandu. I'll definitely come back to Shivapuri Heights Cottage if/when I return to Nepal."
610,Namkha Khyung Dzong Rigdin Choling Monastery,Religious Sites,5,Beautiful walk in the hills of Shivapuri,"This wonderful walk was organised by Steve at Shivapuri Heights Cottage.  We meandered through footpaths amongst trees, through a local village, walked higher up behind the cottage further along the ridge and back to the cottage. The scenery was beautiful, the walk was very pleasant and I enjoyed spotting the abundant local insect and plant species. A tasty packed lunch was prepared and eaten next to a waterfall, a really lovely walk suitable for all age ranges."
611,Namkha Khyung Dzong Rigdin Choling Monastery,Religious Sites,5,Short and sweet. Lovely breath of fresh air.,"The monastery is situated right on the foothills of Shivapuri national park. Only a 30/40 min drive up to Budhanilkantha from the city centre. Our walk was organised by Shivapuri Heights cottage (SHC) run by Steve Webster and his wife Neeru. The walk and lunch itinerary was just perfect for us as we only wanted a short day walk that included the Buddhist heritage. The walk last two hours, 1 hour there from SHC and back. Steve our guide is a British national who has lived in Nepal for 20+ years and really knows a lot about the country and was very knowledgable about Buddhism and the surroundings. A great naturalist too! We took a tour around the monastery and were able meet and greet with the monks. We headed back to SHC where we were welcomed with a fantastic buffet spread.  An array of dishes with freshly picked vegetables from their own garden. I am a vegetarian and I was in heaven! After lunch, I indulged in a nice massage in Neeru's spa. The message therapy was very relaxing and the masseuse really knew what she was doing. Very professional. What a perfect end to the day! I would definitely recommend both the walk and SHC to families, couples, solo travellers. It really is a great little find with great hospitality.Thanks Shivapuri heights team. I will be back."
612,Namkha Khyung Dzong Rigdin Choling Monastery,Religious Sites,5,A delightful Walk in the Shivapuri Hills,"We took this walk, as part of our stay at the charming Shivapuri Heights Cottage. The walk takes about 2 hours, and was led by Steve, our host at Shivapuri who is a Nepal ""veteran"" with a relaxed manner, and a wealth of knowledge about Nepal in general, and the Shivapuri area in particular as well as detailed knowledge of the Namka Monastery and its surroundings.The walk is through farmland and local villages, and provides splendid views across of the Kathmandu valley below. Arriving at the monastery a service was in progress, and we were allowed to observe monks young and old as they performed  their  ceremony--from ringside seats--fascinating!  After the service Steve gave us a guided tour of the monastery and an explanation of Buddhism and the Thangkas and statues which adorn the monastery.We returned to Shivapuri via a different route in which Steve pointed out Buddhist stupas and explained their significance. With waving prayer flags along the way, the walk was a delight.Arriving at Shivapuri Heights we were welcomed with cooling drinks and were served with an excellent lunch on the terrace of the Cottage which enjoys some of the best views of the Kathmandu valley.For my wife, the icing on the cake was a gentle a soothing massage in Neeru's spa. Whether taken as a stand alone booking, or as part of a stay at Shivapuri Heights Cottage this walk is a delight. Book for the walk, lunch and a visit to the Spa for an experience which will stay long in the memory."
613,Namkha Khyung Dzong Rigdin Choling Monastery,Religious Sites,5,"Great walk, fantastic views!","The walk to Namkha Monastery all together took us 2 hours. 1 hour there and another hour to Shivapuri Cottage for lunch - and it was certainly worth it! After starting our way from Hari Krishna Temple, we made it to the Namkha Monastery where we were greeted by astounding, traditional Buddhist tanka paintings both inside and outside the monastery. We spent 45 minutes at the monastery where we were told about the tanka paintings in depth by Steve. We learnt a lot about the Buddhist culture and what each painting represents or means. The walk is fairly easy, along the country side and has a few ups and downs but is not difficult at all! On a sunny day, I would definitely recommend to take a hat and some sunblock. After visiting the monastery, we went to Shivapuri Heights Cottage for a delicious ""Dahl Bhat"" with some cold lemon squash, whilst enjoying the spectacular views of Kathmandu city. A perfect day!"
614,Namkha Khyung Dzong Rigdin Choling Monastery,Religious Sites,5,Great walk to Namkha Monastery,We did a lovely walk organised by Shivapuri heights cottage to the Namkha Monastery. The walk took us through villages and farmland and had great views of the valley. The Monastery was beautifully decorated and we were lucky to be able to join the monks in their prayers. We finished at the Shivapuri  Cottage and enjoyed a superb Nepali cuisine lunch with a lovely view.
615,Namkha Khyung Dzong Rigdin Choling Monastery,Religious Sites,5,"Lovely Monastery away from hectic Kathmandu,  great walk","The Namkha Monastery is located on the north side of the Kathmandu Valley,  in the Shivapuri foothills,  close to Budhanilkantha.  It is a beautifully decorated and peaceful Buddhist Monastery dedicated to the Nyingmapa School of Buddhism.  Inside and outside are beautiful paintings and statues of Buddha and the Guru Ringpoche and others.  We did a walk organised by Shivapuri Heights Cottages that run a charming guest house in the hills nearby.  We booked one of their walk and lunch packages that was advertised on their website and were met of the owner of the Cottages Mr Steve at the Hare Krishna Temple.  The first bit of the walk took us on the road through the local village.   Steve then took us around the Monastery and explained about the paintings and the statues and gave us some in-depth information of the origins of Buddhism and the different branches.  We even learned about reincarnation !   From the Monastery the walk took us on a high trail through charming local villages and farmland.  On the way we stopped at some Buddhist Stupas on the side of the hill where there fluttering prayer flags and a lovely view of the valley below.  We were really lucky with the weather.   The walk took us about 2 hours including a 45 minute stop at the Monastery.  The final walk to the Cottages was up some steep steps but it was worth it.  We were greeted with a cold and refreshing glass of homemade lemonade and then treated to a delicious lunch of salads and Quiche and with the best view of Kathmandu.  We wish we had booked a night at the Cottages since the rooms looked really cozy and comfortable but we will be back another time.  Thanks to Steve for sharing his knowledge and for a great day out.  Highly recommended !"
616,Casino Mahjong,Casinos,3,Worst casino no service to customers,"Worst kind of customer service, I am not sure how they got the best casino award, none of the slot machines work.  If you are not playing any table games you become invisible to the serving staff and to top it up food also is not served if you only have coupon coins."
617,Casino Mahjong,Casinos,3,worst,"its a single word review for the casino worst we have visited 3 casino of nepal and only this one is worst in terms of service , food quality and hospitality promised while booking and providednever ever go to the casino"
618,Casino Mahjong,Casinos,3,Bad casino for poker,Strangely weird place for poker no player no service for poker they try to lure u with there dirty dancing and irritating flush floor managers who think flush is only game people should play
619,Casino Mahjong,Casinos,3,Nice casino,It was very nice experience. The crowd was also good. The managers and staff was very co operative. We stayed for 3 days we went everyday to play casino there . This casino was biggest of all . The machines were well organised . I liked the casino mahyong the most of all casinos in Kathmandu.
620,Casino Mahjong,Casinos,3,"Indecent Crowd, Hostile Staff & Awful Food","This casino is definitely overrated. For all those who go to Nepal to gamble at the Casino, this is definitely NOT the place to be. It is more like a dance bar where girls are dancing on the stage on one side and men throwing money on them in a drunken state. The food served is of pathetic quality.We visited with family with teenagers. Firstly there is no minimum age requirement for entry.Second, if you are allowing minors to enter then the environment should be kids friendlyThirdly, the staff is very cheeky. I requested them thrice to send a waiter over as I wanted to place an order for a drink. someone was sent when I lost my cool and complained after waiting for almost 25 minutes. I ordered a vodka with water but after having a few sips I realised that it was absolutely neat and was done on purpose to sort of 'teach me a lesson' for complaining.It's was a real sad place to be with a pretty indecent crowd. I would never go there again nor would advice anyone else."
621,Casino Mahjong,Casinos,3,Amazing,"The sun never sets on the casinos in Kathmandu. Excitement and gaming goes on 24 hours a day, seven days a week at the casinos of Nepal with international games like Blackjack, Baccarat, Pontoon, Roulette, Flush, Beat the Dealer and Slot machines, providing the best night life in the region."
622,Casino Mahjong,Casinos,3,Not per my liking but who cares!!!,Casino Mahjong is situated in Hotel Crowne Plaza and is one of biggest and busiest casinos in Kathmandu. Be ready for floor full of cigarette smoke and badly diluted drinks if you wish to try you luck here. When we went casino was full of people who were badly dressed up and seemed like not have taken bath since days. I think this casino allows everyone to enter and play till the time you have money. Therefore you can find groups of uncivilized drunk people creating ruckus. Though this casino also provide good security and there were lot of bouncers on the floor. But if you have your pockets filled up well you can cross lines without any fear of being thrown out. Dinner served is not good and crowd is not properly managed.
623,Casino Mahjong,Casinos,3,Good experience,"Casino Mahjong is inside Hotel Soltee Crowne Plaza. Since i was staying here , decided to go there in the evening just for fun. You need to show Passport to enter as officially Nepalese are not allowed to go inside; though there is no entry fee. The entire casino is on the first floor, a big place with lot of Casino games like Roulette, Slotting machine, card games etc ; along with foods and drinks. There is live dance show going on with mostly Indian film songs. We tried a little bit on the slotting machine with pre-decided budget. Overall a decent experience."
624,Casino Mahjong,Casinos,3,Good Casino,"We had never visited a Casino before so this time we planned to visit one. Mahjong was on walking distance from Hotel Grand . On the very first day of our tour we had nothing to do so we visited Mahjong Casino. We were afraid as the casinos are thought to be a place for spoiled ,drunks and those who gamble ( my view was this). The environment was quite good . Nobody insisted us for playing etc. We puchased  coins for Rs. 1000 and played for 1-12 group. Oh god 9 number came and our money tripled.Then we played 3 more games and ended up loosing all but no regret. Dance was going on on Bollywood numbers. Over all a good experience. No photos allowed."
625,Casino Mahjong,Casinos,3,Ended up loosing,"Casino Mahjong is in Hotel Crowne Plaza in Soaltee, Kathmandu. I have been to few other casinos in Kathmandu and this is the first time in Mahjong. Not a bad experience. Seems the management is Chinese. Few game areas are there. It gets unbelievably crowded by about 9-10pm. Nepalis are not allowed in to any Casinos in Kathmandu so better carry your passport. Men should be in shoes. Sanders and slippers are not allowed. I only played Roulette. There are electronic Roulette machines also available. Though it says Nepalis are not allowed in o felt there have been so many of them inside along with a heavy presence of Indians. The staff support and customer care is good. Good is average. With drinks my friend had a sever issue. He ordered Chivas but offered something horrible in a Chivas bottle. Better if you can stick to beer."

628,"The Tribhuvan,Mahendra,and Birendra Museums",Speciality Museums,3.5,Tribhuvan Mahendra and Birendra Museums – part of the larger Hanuman Dhoka Palace,Both of these museums were closed to the public when we visited in May/June 2017.  You can see the outside of the museums and there was a gift shop that was open.  Both museums are part of the larger Hanuman Dhoka Palace complex which is reviewed separately.  Be careful since there are multiple Durbar squares and this is the one in Kathmandu.  We hired a guide and driver to get here. The guide knows so much more than your typical guidebook and will answer your questions. We used Pradip Lama (Pradiplama@hotmail.com) as our guide and he was terrific.
629,"The Tribhuvan,Mahendra,and Birendra Museums",Speciality Museums,3.5,A museum at Nepal's former royal palace!,"The famous ""Hanuman Dhoka Palace"", on Durbar Square in Central Kathmandu, houses the ""Tribuhvan, Mahendra and Birendra Museums"". The palace's construction started on the 17th Century by the Rana Kings, and continued until late 19th century by the Malla and Shah dinasties. Until 1886, the kings of Nepal lived in this palace named after Hanuman, the Hindu God depicted in the form of a monkey (an incarnation of God Shiva), and a helper of God Rama (an incarnation of God Vishnu). A kneeling statue of Hanumam sits on a tall stone pedestal right at the golden palace's doors. As far as collections are concerned (thrones, personal effects, jewelry, pictures and coins belonging to Kings Tribuhvan, Mahendra and Birendra), it is not so impressive. But the beautiful architecture and woodcarved doors and windows are really breathtaking. I visited Kathmandu on February 2015, nearly two and a half months before the terrible earthquake that devastated Nepal on April 25, 2015. As far as I could check, the Hanuman Dhoka Palace was severely and sadly damaged by the earthquake and it is still closed to public visitation. There are yet no news about its re-opening in the near future. But Durbar Square is open to public and safe to visitors. Let's support Nepaleses' efforts towards Kathmandu's reconstruction!"

649,Gaddhi Baithak,Architectural Buildings,3,Our of place in Durbar Square?,"This white European neo-classical building on the eastern side of the palace seems somewhat out of place in Kathmandu Durbar Square. Now fully restored after earthquake damage, it looms large over the various temples, etc."
650,Gaddhi Baithak,Architectural Buildings,3,British Influence In Durbah Square,This white edifice in the Durbah Square was the Palace occupied by the Rana's who ruled  between 1846 and 1951 and were very pro-British hence the design. This place was partialyy destroyed in April 2015 and has now been fixed.It seems somewhat out of place with the other buildings in this square.
651,Gaddhi Baithak,Architectural Buildings,3,There is a hope for restoration of this architecture pearl,"Dominating the eastern side of Durbar Sq, this white neoclassical building, part of the Hanuman Dhoka palace build in 1908 as a memorial to the imported European style that became fashionable in Nepal during the Rana period, lost parts of its facade during the 7.8 magnitude earthquake in 2015. Its future seems uncertain because of apathy of the government towards restoring this building, till this September.In September 2017 was announced, that palace is set to be repaired and structurally strengthened by the U.S. Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation with expected cost Rs 70 million and will be completed within two years.It is probably the most economically viable project with rentable space as a wonderful hall and commercial usage of the rooms as a hotel. Hope there will it be possible to save this building. Its really sad to see such a beautiful example of colonial architecture in rumble."

That was a huge shock for this reason we will never go back there."
654,Casino Rad,Casinos,3,WARNING!!! Casino Staff Are Very RUDE,"We went to this 5 star hotel to play casino, and the female staff working the food treated us very disrespectfully.

661,Casino Rad,Casinos,3,Good place to go,"They have best slot game machines in Nepal, and provide nice dancing show, foods & drinks. Definitely a good choice to spend your night time in Kathmandu."
662,Casino Rad,Casinos,3,Worst place to be in if you are in Kathmandu,"Hospitality sucks, Not at all lively, Ambiance is very sad and food is yuck. I have wasted my 90 minutes at this place where you don't want to even stop and pee. Not at all recommended if you are in kathmandu."
663,Sundarijal waterfall,Waterfalls,5,Best place to hike in Kathmandu.,"If you are fit or want yourself to be fit while having a good time, hiking on Sundarijal is the best thing you can do. It's safe, fun and refreshing. If you are a religious person sundarimai temple is a must go, if you are not a religious person, just below the temple is a river beach, stay there for a while and enjoy life. If you are with your partner; even better. And please do WALK! Walk as much as you can, explore as much as you can but not into dangerous areas. Be sure to take enough food because you will be tired, but it's all worth it."
664,Sundarijal waterfall,Waterfalls,5,must go place,"The place is peaceful, beautiful and full of adventure.  We got to taste some delicious local cuisine with local chang. Due to Covid-19 police did not allow us to visit waterfall but still we really had fun."
665,Sundarijal waterfall,Waterfalls,5,surprisingly amazing,The place is a water spot and trekking area. The food is okish around the place. Mainly couples and groups of friends are seen at this place.
666,Sundarijal waterfall,Waterfalls,5,Take your passport!,"Having read some of the reviews of this attraction, I had not seen it mentioned that foreign visitors have to show their passports when buying an entry ticket.  It was purely by chance that I happened to be carrying my passport with me, otherwise the 1 1/2 hr car journey from Kathmandu and 1/2 hr uphill climb would have been for nothing!  Do take sturdy footwear, at least trail shoes, as the path is very steep and rocky.  Also, visitors not at the peak of fitness (like me!!) might take up to an hour to climb up to the entrance to the actual park itself, so allow plenty of time for your visit.  We had a hire car waiting for us below and ran out of time, and had to return before we even caught sight of a waterfall :( !"
667,Sundarijal waterfall,Waterfalls,5,Experiencing Nature adjacent to the city,"So, in a trip to Kathmandu when you wish to explore the nature, then simply drive to this place. Easily accessible and a perfect place for a day trip. As the word SundariJal denotes for the beautiful water, so is the waterfalls. Just get prepared for this trip with your loved ones or the friends or the families. Equally worthwhile to get refreshed and immerse with the nature."
668,Sundarijal waterfall,Waterfalls,5,Prestine destination near the capital!,I have been here many times and within a few days I am heading again. Highly reccommanded! Sacred river Bagmati comes out of the Tiger mouth structured rock immersed in the lush green. It is also a favorite destination of picnic lovers and hikers.
669,Sundarijal waterfall,Waterfalls,5,Beautiful green place with waterfalls in Kathmandu valley,"We took the Taxi from Boudhanath and in 20 minutes we arrived at the main gate. The place is very beautiful and from the begining you have the chance to enjoy the view Of the river and environment.To get to the water dam, it takes about an hour of trekking and the path can be slipery so Wear comfortable shoes!!At the half-Way to the water dam, there is a stop with huge waterfalls :)I absolutely loved that place! It's perfect for one day trip at Kathmandu valley Little advice - if you travel by Taxi- it won't be a bad idea to ask him to Wait for you, as well , because we waited for the Taxi to come for 20 minutes :/."
670,Sundarijal waterfall,Waterfalls,5,Underestimated this ! Need 2-3 hrs. Skip if you have children below 10 yrs old,"We allotted only 1 hour for this. Midway, we realized there still a 30 minute hike and had to turn back. If you are with children below 10 yrs old, I recommend you skip this."
671,Shiva Mandir Temple,Architectural Buildings/Religious sites,3.5,You'll walk by it on your way to other sites,Not much to see except one temple in a crowded section of Kathmandu covered with fabrics and goods for sale. It is on a very busy and well traveled street. Doesn't cost anything so a look is a no brainer!
672,Shiva Mandir Temple,Architectural Buildings/Religious sites,3.5,Beautful but neglected,"This is a beautiful but neglected temple.  I was told by my unofficial tour guide that it had all been carved from one bit of stone but I'm not sure if that's true, I've not been able to find much information about the temple.There weren't the scarves there when I visited but it was surrounded by motorbikes as if it was inconveniently there in the middle of a parking lot."
673,Shiva Mandir Temple,Architectural Buildings/Religious sites,3.5,A beautiful temple,This temple seems a neglected one. In the middle of the streets. All around so many people are there. Shawls are sold on the premises of the the temple.

676,Bhagwati Mandir Temple,"Points of Interest and Landmarks, Religious Sites",4.5,Another temple in Durbar Square Kathmandu,"This triple-roofed temple is easily missed because it is actually part of the Hanuman Dhoka palace courtyard.

685,Big Bell,Points of Interest and Landmarks,3.5,Another feature of Durbar Square (aka Tago Gan),"This is quite a recent addition to Durbar Square, having been built in 1997 by King Rana Bahadur Shah and his queen Raj Rajeswori.

687,Migrasthali Deer Park,"Nature and Wildlife Areas, Parks",4,"Nice park, though I didn't see any deer","It's a nice park for a walk, with some temples you can visit. No sign of any deer, unfortunately. It's on a hill near Pashupati Nath overlooking the Bagmati River.You do have to climb up. It's definitely not accessible."
688,Migrasthali Deer Park,"Nature and Wildlife Areas, Parks",4,'Divine Play of Creation',"From the bank of Bagmati on the other side of the Temple of Pashupatinath, you have to walk about 100 steps and you reach the 'slesmantak vana' which is now named as the Deer Park. Myths related to this tell about how Shiva and Parvati danced and transfigured themselves into different human and animal forms. Now many varieties of medicinal plants are planted and different species of animals are also kept including deer, goats cows, etc. Must visit"
689,Migrasthali Deer Park,"Nature and Wildlife Areas, Parks",4,MriGa thali,"Mriga Mean the Deer and thali mean The place,it mean Deer place.the Dear park is also located in the pashupati  area. In this pashupati area you found Monkey, deer,cow and various kinds of birds."

Everything. Unfortunately there is a hefty entry fee, and that does not allow you to visit temples if you are not from the Indian Sub Continent. No foreigners allowed. Not even Hindu foreigners! In the zeal to preserve purity, this is not a good option for tourists."
691,Universal Crafts,"Art Galleries, Antique Shops, Monuments and Statues",5,Fantastic experience,"We bought 2 paintings from here today for 3 specific reasons. 1: the art is beautiful. 2: we were able to browse without being constantly pestered by someone trying to make a sale. 3: The seller did not try to rip us off, he gave us a reasonable price from the get go unlike other galleries we went to. 10/10 would recommend this art gallery!"

693,Universal Crafts,"Art Galleries, Antique Shops, Monuments and Statues",5,Perfect treasure to take home,"After shopping around, we can highly recommend choosing Universal Art Gallery. Bikash has so many beautiful paintings to choose from, in an assortment of sizes and orientations. There is a wide variety of mountain landscapes and Nepalese scenes/people, from numerous local artists, at a reasonable price. Bikash was happy to show us numerous paintings and to allow us lots of time to think through our purchase, without pressuring us to buy. He can accept cash or card and can organise posting the painting to your home, if you can't carry it or if you are continuing your travels. A great shopping experience and if you have time he loved telling us about his other projects, helping orphaned children in rural Nepal."
694,Mero Chitra Wears,Factory Outlets,5,Unique very cool local design t-shirts,I visit KTM frequently and this place is unique. The shirts are high quality and sold at reasonable no-haggle prices. Designs and production are local. The designs are thoughtful and cool looking. I bought one shirt last visit and am back for more. The owners are super nice and have a higher-consciousness about why they're running a shop. Definitely stop in.
695,Mero Chitra Wears,Factory Outlets,5,Very interesting tshirts.,Tshirts are of really nice quality at very reasonable price. Loved its unique prints. Very different from other you find on the way.
696,Casino Everest,Casinos,3.5,"Small to Medium sized casino, some tables empty, others overcrowded","The roulette tables are overcrowded and others like blackjack are totally empty. The tables are on the left side as you enter and to the right is a stage where there are live performance (dances to indian songs mostly) and then in front of the stage there are tables to sit down and have drinks and buffet meals. The food is ok. Overall, I thought it was as much as you could expect in Nepal."
697,Casino Everest,Casinos,3.5,Beaware in night,"Staff is very rude and even for one glass of juice and beer ,you need to ask many times and transport facility is so pathetic that you will feel very scary during night.overall it is good but due to some staff , it is becoming uncomfortable for some people."
698,Casino Everest,Casinos,3.5,never win,I been this casino few times but i only loose my money.I never won.I love the drinks & food.There seems many indian & nepali people glambing.
699,Casino Everest,Casinos,3.5,gamblers paradise,those who are really good with gambling can go there and have fun.... but poeple like us ( practising muslims) might find it a bit uncomfortable...i was with my husband and went there as we got a coupon and stayed for a while and gt back....there were exposing dances and guys were throwing money.... overall we didnt feel comfortable...not our place
700,Casino Everest,Casinos,3.5,Nice place,Expect less here and you will not get disappointed. Overall good place.
701,Casino Everest,Casinos,3.5,Top Notch Service,"I have never got service like this in any casino globally. All the food and drinks are for free, Anything you want. Stayed at the Everest Hotel which houses this casino. Checked out some of the other casino's including casino Royale but this one was the best. Great entertainment. They had dancers from Bollywood as well.  ;)"
702,Maju Dega Mandir Temple,"Architectural Buildings, Religious Sites",3,Renovation progressing slowly,"As the previous reviewer observed, this temple was completely devastated in the 2015 earthquake. Not much progress has been made over the subsequent two and a half years, although there were signs of some ongoing work during our visit to Durbar Square.All we have for now are old photos of what it looked like before the catastrophe."
703,Maju Dega Mandir Temple,"Architectural Buildings, Religious Sites",3,Only the base survives.,"This temple built in the late 17th century was a towered affair with 3 levels. It apparently dominated the square and was beautifully carved, but the tower is now gone. There is really nothing to see!"
704,Gauri Gaht,"Points of Interest and Landmarks, Architectural Buildings, Religious Sites",,Interesting place,Very interesting place to visit. Its the place  where cremation takes place. It was extraordinary and scary-ish experience coming here
705,Monasterio Tibetano Boudhanat,Religious Sites,4,Esperienza da fare,"Monastero tibetano, assolutamente da visitare, anche se, durante le giornate di festa, risulta difficile godere appieno del luogo. Salite anche ai piani superiori e godetevi la vista dello stupa (soprattutto se  un giorno di sole)"
706,Monasterio Tibetano Boudhanat,Religious Sites,4,Monastero tibetano sulla piazza dello stupa di Boudhnat,Anche questo  un pezzetto di Tibet in Nepal.La cosa migliore  il balcone al primo piano da cui si vede tutta la piazza e si possono fare belle foto dello stupa.
707,Monasterio Tibetano Boudhanat,Religious Sites,4,Una maravilla,En mitad de la plaza de Boudhanath enfrente de la estupa.Cuando entras te encuentras con una rueda gigante de oraciones.Las escaleras y el templo decorado profsamente con temas budistas.Desde la terraza hay unas vistas magnficas de la estupa.Maravilloso.Imprescindible
708,Kalikasthan Temple,Religious Sites,4,Good temple near the Immigration Office,"This is a good little temple. It's not one of the biggest and most ornate, but it's worth a visit if you are in the neighborhood."
709,Kirateshwar  Mahadev,Religious Sites,4,Unusual linga,"This is a Shiva temple, but the linga is the most unusual one I have ever seen anywhere. The temple is situated on a hill in the deer park behind Pashupati Nath. What might appear to be the entrance (a black door) is closed, but the entrance on the other side around to the left of it is open. The temple itself is quite plain, unlike most of the temples in the area. There is a little music school that operates there. When I was visiting, there were two people playing bamboo flutes. The music was also unusual, and really slow. If you walk beyond the temples up the hill or down into the valley, there are more temples. The ones on the hill are quite modern and uninteresting, but you can walk down to the Gorakhnath Mandir and the Manakamana Mandir in the valley. It's a nice walk through the deer park to get to the templea little steep, but not too far. There's a tea stall by the temple, and some benches. It would be a nice place for a picnic. There is also a viewpoint overlooking Pashpati Nath a short walk away."
710,Khawalung Monastery,Religious Sites,4.5,Great volunteer stay,"The kwawalung monastery is very beautiful. The monks are really nice and friendly. We stayed for 2 weeks teaching English to the 8-16 year old monks. We arranged it via InspireNepal and can recommend it very much! There were about 6-8 other volunteers so preparation of the classes was split. The food is not very variable, loads of dal bhat, but better than we expected. The tea is great! Rooms are very very basic and not too clean. Don't come with your white shirts!"
711,Khawalung Monastery,Religious Sites,4.5,Awesome,That was awesome feeling bt some thing missing..we enjoy a lot and cheering the old moments ..it was surprised visit for us..
712,Khawalung Monastery,Religious Sites,4.5,The best experience in Kathmandu before and after trekking in the Himalayas!,"We have visited the Monastery. The area is so quite with great views of the mountains. We assisted to some meditations with the monks and we wanna come back!! They were very welcoming and funny.  The Monastery is so beautiful and they  love to talk about their religion, tradition and customs."
713,Khawalung Monastery,Religious Sites,4.5,"Friendly people, wonderful local experience","I stayed here for roughly a week just to catch a local monastery experience in Boudha. It was a wonderful experience. Basic, but incredibly cheap, the food is plentiful, and the monks - both those running the place and living here - were fantastic! A great group of kids, they let me teach some English classes and watch movies with them, join puja ceremony, and we spent some great times together.Also, the monastery itself is beautiful.Highly recommended for anyone wanting to experience local Buddhist monk culture here in Nepal."
714,Khawalung Monastery,Religious Sites,4.5,GORGEOUS - and peaceful...,"I have to say, I have been to many monasteries and they are all pretty nice, but his has a real sense of calm, and it is just plain uplifting! In a city of the absurd, this is a wonderful outlet."
715,Khawalung Monastery,Religious Sites,4.5,Very rich culture monastery near Bodhnath Stupa,"This monastery is open in 2005, founded by Lama Jigme Dorjee. It includes a school for Buddhist studies and retreat. The monastery boasts many beautiful wall paintings and has rich Tibetan heritage. Do make a visit here if you are at Bodhnath Stupa or Hyatt Hotel. It's about 10-15 mins taxis drive. Tell the taxis driver the name of monastery - Khawalung."
716,Vishnu Mandir Temple,"Points of Interest and Landmarks, Architectural Buildings",4,City of Temples !,"Kathmandu has lots of temples, but each of them leaves a different impression on you. Vishnu Mandir Temple is one of the most important ones."
717,Vishnu Mandir Temple,"Points of Interest and Landmarks, Architectural Buildings",4,Small but important,"We cant give less than a 4 grade to the attractions in Durbar Square, at least they are very interesting. They are small, nowadays they are damaged by the earthquake, with woods against the walls do they dont fall but all them has its importance in the Square history, specially this small one called Vishnu mandir"
718,Vishnu Mandir Temple,"Points of Interest and Landmarks, Architectural Buildings",4,One more temple in Durbar Square,Old beautiful temples are around the Durbar Square. This temple too met with the damages during the recent earthquake. Restoration work in progress but not in the desired pace.
719,Dolma Treks,"Historic Sites, Historic Walking Areas",5,The best holiday you will ever have,"Wow! What an experience it was to do the Everest Base Camp walk from Shivalaya, with the inclusion of Gokyo via the Chola Pass in December 2019 - January 2020 with Dolma Treks and Adventure! My boyfriend and I had been planning to do the Three Passes walk from Shivalaya with Everest Base Camp but we were unsure how we were going to go about it. We were in a very stressful period with finishing uni and starting new jobs and trying to organise it all ourselves was too much in a short period of time. So a mate of mine put me on to Tsering who owns Dolma Treks, and what a pleasure it was! Tsering not only listened to the things that we wanted to do and wrote an incredible itinerary that was solely catered for us with limited time but he was super flexible and understanding when we had to change dates a fair few times due to work and university issues. He communicated with us through Facebook in a friendly and polite way that wasnt pushy or manipulating for his self gain in any way. The whole booking process was extremely easy, and we were a little concerned to give over the reins so easily to someone we hardly knew. When we arrived however I could instantly see that we had nothing to worry about. The genuine and ever smiling Tsering went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and get everything comfortable and sent for an early start the following morning. We stayed at his house in Kathmandu and met his beautiful family who also went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. We knew this was an authentic and fair, family run business. Even in the morning when we met with our driver for the day and with our wonderful, funny and very experienced guide Mingmar, you could tell that Tsering looked after not only his customers but his employees as well. They were all happy, laughing and smiling with each other, and seemed genuinely happy to be working, which says a lot about the business! Tsering paired us up with Mingmar as our very competent, English speaking guide and his son Dawa as our porter who also spoke English. Throughout the whole trip they were always extremely patient with our struggling knees and constant stopping to take photos, and always catered to our needs. Mingmar had done the walk countless times and knew almost every single person that we passed on the journey, as he had built up friendly relationships with them over the last 30years. He made sure we stayed at the best places and had the best rooms in each of those places. Because he knew everyone so well, the guesthouse owners that we stopped in at along the way were also willing to go above and beyond for us, something which other groups along the way struggled with. As said previously, Mingmar was very experienced and was able to guide us though any type of weather event, even when 50cm of fresh snow covered any trace of a path and we were the only ones walking or when thick clouds came in while we were crossing the Ngozumpa Glacier and it was a total white out. He also knew where and when all the best spots and times for photos and views of Everest and the other major sites were. When bad weather set in near the end of our walk and we had to change our plans, Mingmar - in conjunction with Tsering - was quick to adapt our schedule and route to get us a flight out of Lukla back to Kathmandu. And because we missed some nights walking due to bad weather, he and Tsering organised a beautiful hotel room in the heart of Kathmandu at the International Guesthouse where he then took us around and showed us the sites of his neighbourhood, where to buy the best quality goods from and where the best cafes and restaurants were. I would definitely go with him again! All in all this was an extremely well run, and thorough trekking company run by local Nepalese people to support the Nepalese community and give back. It was stress free, hassle free and relaxing - something which I thought would not go hand in hand with walking to Base Camp. Everything was thought of, and everything was included. Tsering and Mingmar were both passionate about showing people a more traditional side of Nepal and making sure smaller local communities benefit from your tourism. I would without a doubt go with Dolma Treks again! Five stars from us!"
720,Dolma Treks,"Historic Sites, Historic Walking Areas",5,Great 2 weeks in Langtang National Park,"A wonderful trek in Nepal - the 1st for me but the 3rd for some of my companions, all with Dolma Treks. Tsering ensured we all had the personal attention we needed and has a very well prepared team of guides & porters and excellent connections with the all-important tea houses. It was clear that we were cared for much better than other touring groups."
721,Dolma Treks,"Historic Sites, Historic Walking Areas",5,Time of our lives,"We had a full week in Nepal guided by Dolma treks...it included pick up from and to the airport to our hotel- our transportation to the trekking areas and our guide and porter into the mountains. They were nothing short of fantastic. Took care of all of our needs. They were totally flexible when we wanted to change direction a bit and accommodating in every sense of the word. We are novices at this kind of travel so were totally anxious about the process- I can say, without hesitation, that we will be doing this again with Dolma Treks. They know exactly what to do and how to prepare you for this trip. It was one of the best moments of our lives. Thanks Dolma Treks!"
722,Chyasin Dega Temple,Religious Sites,3.5,Yet another temple in Durbar Square,"This three roof octagonal temple is quite easily missed given the number of temples in the square, but is situated right next to the 'Great Drums'. The guide describes it as the temple of Vansagopal (i.e. Krishna playing a flute) which was built in 1649 by Pratap Matal in memory of his two dead queens."
723,Bhadrakali Temple,Religious Sites,5,Sorry about wedding crashing,"I think I may have just crashed a wedding. Not sure if I did but it wasnt my intention. I found this temple while taking a walk and thought to check it out. Little did I know theres like some wedding ceremony going on. Could be even more than one. Not sure, forgive my ignorance."
724,Bhadrakali Temple,Religious Sites,5,Central Temple of Kathmandu,"Its a round shaped temple located at Bhadrakali army camp, straight on the way to Singhadurbar, i was there on my friends marriage ceremony. The ceromony was late night but its was cool with temple lights."

726,Bhadrakali Temple,Religious Sites,5,'Powerful Goddess Temple between Singha Durbar and Suun Dhara',"Bhadrakali is the sober representation of wrathful Goddess Kali. Every Thursday, Tuesday and Saturday many devotees visit this temple to offer prayers. She bestows health, harmonious relationships, and protects her devotees from any unforeseen calamities and premature deaths. This an open canopy covered temple is in a courtyard which can be visited by anyone. Must visit sacred power place."
727,Bhadrakali Temple,Religious Sites,5,To seek blessings.,I went there with my husband to seek blessings of Goddess. At the entrance there is a big statue of Ganesha. Then there is a main temple where the Goddess is kept. Very spiritual area.

731,Bhadrakali Temple,Religious Sites,5,Lovely Open-Air KaliTemple,"My husband and I visited the Bhadrakali Temple during our visit to Kathmandu. The temple is located approximately 30 minutes (leisurely) walk from the main tourist district of Thamel. You can purchase puja items for around 30 rupees outside of the temple front gate. The temple is open to the sky, quite how I like to think Kali would like it. Tourists can go and do puja themselves. It was a quite a lovely experience visiting this temple. Please be respectful if you go such as to retain the accepting atmosphere of the pujaris (mainly females)."
732,The City Museum Kathmandu,Specialty Museums,4,Manish,"Nice and clean rooms,liked the ethnic style, value for money. Breakfast in the adjoining cafe is good but limited options."
733,The City Museum Kathmandu,Specialty Museums,4,Location details not updated!,"I found this museum actually through Google maps, and double-checked the location and address from their website, as well as from Maps.me app and Trip Advisor, cause this is, well, Kathmandu. Therefore after all this checking it was a huge disappointment not to find the museum. I found the right building, climbed all the way up the stairs, but nothing. Eventually went inside one of the offices and asked from the reception, they told the museum has moved out. But they didn't have any clue where.This gave a really bad impression of the museum authorities' organizing and communication skills. And that's a pity, cause Kathmandu needs something new and fresh like this (this was my 3rd time in Nepal).So if the museum authorities will ever read this ranting, kindly take my advice and update your website as soon as possible!"
734,The City Museum Kathmandu,Specialty Museums,4,Modern museum with a mission,"This is one of the first independent museum which has established its reputation for its dedication to the arts and culture of Nepal. It has also emerged as a space where upcoming artists can showcase their works in a well organised space with plenty of natural light, suitable for all kinds of functions. Conveniently located just off Durbar Marg, it is easy to find, and also houses a tidy caf with eats and bakes, and is one of the few places you can still enjoy flavoured sodas after you pop the marble inside!"
735,The City Museum Kathmandu,Specialty Museums,4,Excellent,Full of artefacts some dating back to 4th century b c highly recommend for a visit you will not be disappointed easy access
736,The City Museum Kathmandu,Specialty Museums,4,a new museum in the heart of kathmandu,"The City Museum of Kathmandu is in a beautiful venue, on the top floor of a 4-storey building with a view across the western side of the city to the hills beyond, We were there in time for a glorious monsoon sunset. The building's architecture combines the best of traditional and modern Nepali styling. The permanent exhibition is a collection of half-century old photographs of the Valley's cities and sacred sites. An exhibition hall features at the moment a wonderful show by a contemporary Nepali painter.

Our guide had to think of something to do with us for an afternoon now that our plan was changed.  He brought us to this temple, and mentioned that it would be very interesting because he didn't think tourists ever go.  The winding street that leads up to the actual temple is lined with food stalls and souvenir stalls, but clearly all targeting local or sort-of local hindus who have travelled here to spend time in a holy place.  Definitely got curious stares and smiles as we walked through.  That day happened to be an animal sacrifice day.  There were people squatting in the river cleaning the entrails of the latest sacrifice.  The heads were inside the actual temple.  We had to take our shoes off to enter.  We got blessed by a local priest inside, and got to ring the bells hanging everywhere as part of the ritual.  The goat's blood was all over the floor.  This experience was not for the faint of heart or for people sensitive to animal rights, but as far as experiencing something truly local, it was incredible."

755,Manakamana Mandir Temple,"Points of Interest and Landmarks, Architectural Buildings, Religious Sites",4,Very crowded Hindu temple,As such the temple remains crowded and we happened to reach on Saturday which is the busiest day. You have to take a cable car to reach the hill. ( 7 am to 12 noon 12 30pm to 5 pm INR 500). Each shuttle carries 8 people so overall 800 people can be transferred by cable car per hour. Still it took 2 hours for us to reach to cable car. Cable car journey is 10 minutes with nice scenes to shoot for. After exiting from cable car one has to climb approximately 100+ steps which are uneven and not suited for elderly people.After reaching temple there are two options. You need to be in queue for a couple of hours more if you want to worship devima from senctum santorum. Otherwise it takes a few minutes to worship Goddess from a distance of 15 feet. Lots of Pooja shops and eateries on the hill. Practically it is a small town in the hill.Killing the goat and cock to offer to Goddess is a routine here.Going down may also involve moderate queue.The cable car station at base does not allow for wheelers to stop for more than 10 minutes so you must have driver's mobile number to call him back for pick up or should be ready to walk up a slope for 20 minutes No dress code. No restrictions on leather items to temple. Mobiles may be carried to top.

757,Manakamana Mandir Temple,"Points of Interest and Landmarks, Architectural Buildings, Religious Sites",4,Main Temple is closed-Cable Car Ride Worth,"The History Of Manaknama Temple goes:The mythical history of the Manakamana goddess dates back to the reign of King Ram Shah of Gorkha. Every night, the kings wife would awake and make her way to a nearby hill. Upon finding his kingly bed empty, Ram Shah decided to feign sleep and follow his queen on her nightly sojourn. He soon found himself outside a large hall, guarded by two massive lions. Inside, the hall was lined with various gods and goddesses, waiting for the queen to chair their heavenly meet. Struck with the fact that his queen was possessed of divine power, the king returned home with a heavy heart.The next morning, he informed his wife of all he had witnessed, claiming that he had seen it all in a dream. No sooner had he revealed his discovery, Ram Shah was struck dead. Back then, the practice of a wife committing Sati by throwing herself on the funeral pyre of her husband was very much in vogue. However, Ram Shahs personal secretary Lakhan Thapa Magar pleaded with the queen not to go through with the practice. The queen, however, assured Thapa Magar that she would return.Months after the death of the king and queen, Thapa Magar heard of a stone discovered by a farmer ploughing his field. When struck by the plough, the stone began to leak a profusion of blood and milk. Thapa Magar rushed to the area and believing the stone to be an incarnation of the dead queen, built a temple there and began to serve the goddess Manakamana. Unlike other Hindu temples, where Brahmins are the priests, the Manakamana temple is served exclusively by the descendents of Lakhan Thapa Magar, who are now in their 17th generation.The main temple has been devastated by 2015 Earth Quake and is under renovation. You can worship in the makeshift temple. This is an important temple for Nepalese and is on way from Kathmandu to Pokhra.The temple is on a Hillock  and Cable Cars take you there.

Should have read some reviews before coming so I would know what to expect but I was thinking it would just be views and a small temple. But after paying the steep $20pp, we took the cable car up and was shocked to see pretty much an entire town up there, with guest houses, restaurants, and street after street of shops selling offerings and tourist tat ! Eventually found the temple, but was completely hidden by scaffolding so couldn't see it at all, but there was a huge queue of hundreds of people waiting to enter the temporary temple to give their offerings.Enjoyed looking around, but was a shame we couldn't see the temple and there weren't any views from the top apart from on the way up and down the cable car, so wouldn't really say it was worth the $20 fee."

It is a dark wood structure that sustained some damage during the earthquake of 2015. The difference is that we see statues of Shiva and Parvati standing by a center window looking out of the front of the temple. Shiva, the destroyer of evil and the transformer and his wife, Parvati, the goddess of fertility, love and devotion are the parents of Ganesh, the deity who has the visage of an elephant. It is apt that when I visited, the statues of Shiva and Parvati are staring out at Kathmandu Durbar Square as it undergoes the massive reconstruction. I fervently wish only the best for this and all of the historical sites in Kathmandu and throughout Nepal as they continue to recover from the tragedy of 2015.

There was a small entry fee for Ratna Park, and probably I was being judgemental as a western tourist, but the park is run down and not well maintained (eg dead flowers, more brown than green). There were some locals there and appeared to cater for young people and couples. I appreciate there is not a lot of open green space in the area so it did at least offer a quieter space from the main streets but it's not a tourist attraction in terms of seeing the flowers."
824,Ratna Park,Parks,2.5,the place is awesom,"This place is clean, and very good for looking the calm conditon. the location i sclose with touristic area."
825,Ratna Park,Parks,2.5,Ratna park,"the park is named by quine ratna rajya laxmi devi shah.Now, a days it  is also a green garden for the public."
826,Ratna Park,Parks,2.5,Locked!,"We were doing our morning tour and planned to visit this park,because it was on our way, not because we thought it would be anything special, but it was locked, and we could not find anything written about the opening hours.We could only see it from outside - it is on the main street and noisy."
827,Ratna Park,Parks,2.5,Not to go,"Located in the center of the city with crowds, noises. Recently it is reconstructed but still is not place for the tourists to visit as it consists very small and noisy area, rather you can go to dream garden."
828,Ratna Park,Parks,2.5,Don't waste your time here,"Ratna Park is a park located at the heart of the city and very near to the bus stand, Ratna Park is a park. Most of the time you can see young couple and elderly people roaming around.Just don't waste your time here and move on if you are a tourist"
829,Ratna Park,Parks,2.5,Not recommended for tourist,this park is attached to ratnapark bus park and poorly maintained and not recommended for tourist even locals of Kathmandu hesitate to go there !!
830,Thahiti Chowk,"Points of Interest and Landmarks, Monuments & Statues",3.5,Must Not Be Missed,"I had the opportunity to visit several temples while in Nepal.  This one had the energy of ""gathering"" and gave me a sense of family.  I'm grateful that I took the time to visit it."
831,Thahiti Chowk,"Points of Interest and Landmarks, Monuments & Statues",3.5,Stupa In A Busy Square,Entrance was through a narrow alley way into a largish sqyare dominated by the Stupa and some smaller temples around the edges.This was a good place for people watching as there were many people around the busy square.
832,Thahiti Chowk,"Points of Interest and Landmarks, Monuments & Statues",3.5,Svayambhunath in the City,"Fascinating small replica of Svayambhunath, also known as Kathesimbu, or Svayambhu (simbu) in Kathmandu (kathe) - right in the middle of courtyard with local monastery where you can meditate. Stupas from 5th to 20th centuries here - but there are pitfalls to be aware of; lots of people want to be ""guides"" here. Some are knowledgeable. Most just want to take you to painting shops and collect a fee. Others will hit you up to buy powdered milk, which they then sell back to stores."
833,Thahiti Chowk,"Points of Interest and Landmarks, Monuments & Statues",3.5,Dharmadhaatu Stupa,"I have passed this square so many times the past few years without realizing its name, which is very typical in Kathmandu. It's a small square where many locals gather to sell produce and goods, but right in the heart of the square lies Dharmadhaatu Stupa.I didn't know the name until a Google map identified it as such.  It is not listed as such on Trip Advisor; however, the square is identified by its chowk name.  You will see other similar stupas and shrines throughout the city, and its worth sampling for the local culture."
834,Thahiti Chowk,"Points of Interest and Landmarks, Monuments & Statues",3.5,A pleasant Stup and aquare to happen across,"The stupa and square are typical of old Kathmandu in a number of ways. there are many such places that one comes across just wandering the alleys that you might not know the name of and that might not appear in guidebooks (though this does). They demonstrate the importance of religion to Kathmanduites in their daily lives and that the stupa, temples or monuments are simply part of everyday living.It's a nice enough place for these reasons, it's vibrant and ordinary at the same time not to dismiss with faint praise though) but what it lacks for most of the day is the peace and quiet to contemplate that somewhere such as the nearby Kathesimbu has - unless the children are playing (which in itself is a wonderful sound)."
835,Thahiti Chowk,"Points of Interest and Landmarks, Monuments & Statues",3.5,Hidden near Chhetrapatti,I Always passed in front the stupa in this chowk while walking from Chhetrapati to places like Rani Pokhari or Ratna Park. The stupa is called Dharmadhaatu and tough small is very beautiful and well preserved
836,Thahiti Chowk,"Points of Interest and Landmarks, Monuments & Statues",3.5,"Colorful place, small but wonderful atmosphere",If you walk from Thamel towards New road you will find a streetlife of its own. Most of the roads nowadays are walking zones so you can fully enjoy the narrow roads. First place you reach is a square with a small Stupa around the local vegetable market. After Tahiti chock the fabric shops start. You will find amazing brocat and silk just next to the Stupa in a little shop. Sunil is one of the last shopkeepers who really daels with brocat from Varanasi. If you continue the small path you will find on the right side another Stupa complex. Also funny the old dentist shops along the way. Its a joyful walsk of maximum 30 minutes until you reach New road or Durbar Square. Every step a picture point!
837,Thahiti Chowk,"Points of Interest and Landmarks, Monuments & Statues",3.5,Worth a quick visit.,"There is nothing much to see but yes a stupa in the middle. So many shops around and always crowded with people. In the evening, a small vegetable market. So you can see the local vegetables."
838,Thahiti Chowk,"Points of Interest and Landmarks, Monuments & Statues",3.5,White stupa,I think I liked the only white stupa there. Small streets so many shops and vegetable market in the evening. Crowded with people all the time.
839,Thahiti Chowk,"Points of Interest and Landmarks, Monuments & Statues",3.5,Nothing much to see.,"Went there to see the beautiful stupa. On seeing stupas, I find peace. Some statues of some other God's are there. In the evening, vegetable vendors sit outside the four walls of the stupa. Worth a visit !"
840,Nara Devi Temple,"Points of Interest and Landmarks, Architectural Buildings, Religious Sites",4.5,Old Temple On A Busy Intersection,"You will find this old temple on a busy square half way between Thamel and the Durbah Square just past the San street and area. It is dedicated to Kali, Shiva's destructive consort which is useful to know."
841,Nara Devi Temple,"Points of Interest and Landmarks, Architectural Buildings, Religious Sites",4.5,"Important, unusual temple in a historic part of Kathmandu","This temple is one of the most important and oldest in Kathmandu. It is situated on the roadside in the heart of the Newari part of the city. Newari are the original inhabitants of Kathmadu. You'll recognise this small temple by the two large dogs sitting either side of the entrance. The surrounding area has many fine examples of temples and shrines, often accessed through small archways in the the street which lead into amazing temple squares. The temple is located on a crossroads (chowk) between Chhetrapati chowk and Durbar Square and needs to be sought out. The lot of the building are old Newari style, ornately carved dark wood beams with red brick. This Nara Devi temple has a long history and should not be missed."
842,Nara Devi Temple,"Points of Interest and Landmarks, Architectural Buildings, Religious Sites",4.5,Good to see the Goddess,Went here with my friends.

845,Military Museum,"Military Museums, History Museums",3.5,better than the national muesum,"located near the Swambhunath temple and opposite to the National Museum. in my opinion, its a better-kept place than the national museum with a good military collection.  has a good legacy of the unification of Nepal and its history."
846,Military Museum,"Military Museums, History Museums",3.5,Great interesting museum,"With all the info we had read about the Gurkhas, this museum cemented everything .

847,Military Museum,"Military Museums, History Museums",3.5,It's All About History,"Museum of Nepal military history. A must for students and/or historians. Entrance showcasing military tanks, helicopter and war plane. A lot of old pictures of persona, guns etc. connected to war. Can't relate much. The only thing that enlightened me was when I saw some fossils of rhinoceros. No pictures allowed to be taken inside, with entrance fee of NRS100 for foreigners."
848,Military Museum,"Military Museums, History Museums",3.5,Cool way to understand Nepal's history,I went to a few museums on a rainy day during monsoon season. This is a nice way to spend a rainy day inside. The museum is a little word heavy so it might not be the best for kids. I did enjoy it and really learned a lot. My favorite part was a map of Nepal that showed when different areas had acquired or lost along with the history of how.
849,Military Museum,"Military Museums, History Museums",3.5,Unfortunately not that great,"Decided to visit this Museum in the early afternoon. There are a few old vehicles on display, weapons collected or used by the Nepal Army. A few paintings of the history and quite a few photos of Army units, and former soldiers that have been awarded medals but that is about it.For foreigners its 100 each for entry plus 50 for each camera, all bags need to be locked in the locker room.Would it be on my list to visit, probably not. Which is a shame as the potential is there."
